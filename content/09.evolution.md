## Evolutionary and Genomic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2

### Abstract

### Introduction

### Initial Characterization of SARS-CoV-2

The first genome sequence of the virus was released on January 3, 2020 and revealed that the cluster of pneumonia cases seen in Wuhan were caused by a novel coronavirus [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017].
Multiple research groups have drafted the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 based on sequences developed from clinical samples collected from the lower respiratory tract, namely bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the upper respiratory tract, in the form of throat swabs [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7; @doi:10/ggjr43].
Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed significant sequence homology with two coronaviruses known to infect humans, with about 79% identity to SARS-CoV-1 and 50% to MERS-CoV [@doi:10/ggjr43].
However, in this analysis, the highest degree of similarity was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) [@doi:10/ggjr43].
Other analyses have reported even greater similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat coronavirus BatCoV-RaTG13, with identity as high as 96.2% [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7; @doi:10.1093/nsr/nwaa036], and the closely related pangolin coronavirus [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This evidence therefore suggests the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the result of zoonotic transfer of a virus from bats to humans.
Nevertheless, some fragments between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 differ by up to 17%, suggesting a complex natural selection process during zoonotic transfer.
While the _S_ region is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253], there is no consensus about the origin of _S_ in SARS-CoV-2, as it could potentially be the result either of recombination or coevolution [@doi:10.1093/nsr/nwaa036; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.abb9153].
Though the intermediate host serving as the source for the zoonotic introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to human populations has not yet been identified, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been placed within the coronavirus phylogeny through comparative genomic analyses.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have originated in a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].
While the position of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the coronavirus phylogeny has been largely resolved, the functional consequences of molecular variation between this virus and other viruses, such as its bat and pangolin sister taxa or SARS-CoV-1, remain unknown [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9, @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7].
Fortunately, the basic genome structure of coronaviruses is highly conserved, and insight into the mechanisms the virus uses to enter cells, replicate, and spread is likely to be available from prior research in coronaviruses.

Additionally, worldwide sequencing of viral samples has provided some preliminary insights into possible mechanisms of adaptation in the virus, and omics-based analysis of patient samples has elucidated some of the biological changes the virus induces in its human hosts.

### Coronaviruses and Animal Hosts

Coronaviruses have long been known to infect animals and have been the subject of veterinary medical investigations and vaccine development efforts due to their effect on the health of companion and agricultural animals [@doi:10/ckfn8b].
<!-- TO DO: Expand on the relationship between coronaviruses and animals -- which taxa are most often affected? how severe are veterinary infections? how has vaccine development worked for these diseases?--> 

<!-- TO DO: Be care to check overlap between this section and 20.pharmaceuticals.md. Trim to address just the important information about human-coronavirus interactions that feeds into an evolutionary perspective of how these host/virus interactions evolve across taxa and over time -->
Most coronaviruses show little to no transmission in humans.
However, today it is thought that approximately one-third of common cold infections are caused by four human coronaviruses (HCoV): _Human coronavirus 229E_ (HCoV-229E), _Human coronavirus NL63_ (HCoV-NL63), _Human coronavirus OC43_ (HCoV-OC43), and _Human coronavirus HKU1_ (HCoV-HKU1) [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9; @doi:10.3390/diseases4030026].
The first HCoV were identified in the 1960s: HCoV-229E in 1965 [@doi:10.3181/00379727-121-30734] and HCoV-OC43 in 1967 [@doi:10.1073/pnas.57.4.933].
Both of these viruses typically cause cold-like symptoms, including upper and lower respiratory infections [@doi:10.1186/1743-422X-1-7; @pmid:20700397; @doi:10.1186/s40779-020-00279-z], but they have also been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms [@doi:10.1111/j.1440-1754.2007.01246.x].
Two additional HCoV were subsequently identified [@doi:10.1038/nm1024; @doi:10.1128/JVI.79.2.884-895.2005].
In 2003, HCoV-NL63 [@doi:10.1038/nm1024] was first identified in a 7-month-old infant and then in clinical specimens collected from seven additional patients, five of whom were infants younger than 1 year old and the remainder of whom were adults.
CoV-HKU1 was identified in samples collected from a 71-year-old pneumonia patient in 2004 and then found in samples collected from a second adult patient [@doi:10.1128/JVI.79.2.884-895.2005].
These viruses are associated with respiratory diseases of varying severity, ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia, with severe symptoms mostly observed in immunocompromised individuals [@doi:10.1086/377612], and also have gastrointestinal involvement in some cases [@doi:10.1111/j.1440-1754.2007.01246.x].
In addition to these relatively mild HCoV, however, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have been identified, including _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1) and _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81; @doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9; @doi:10.1016/bs.aivir.2018.01.001].

At the time that SARS-CoV-1 emerged in the early 2000s, no HCoV had been identified in almost 40 years [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
The first case of SARS was reported in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China, and over the following month, the disease spread more widely within China and then into several countries across multiple continents [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
Unlike previously identified HCoV, SARS was much more severe, with an estimated death rate of 9.5% [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
It was also highly contagious via droplet transmission, with a basic reproduction number (R~0~) of 4 (i.e., each person infected was estimated to infect four other people) [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
However, the identity of the virus behind the infection remained unknown until April of 2003, when the SARS-CoV-1 virus was identified through a worldwide scientific effort spearheaded by the WHO [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
SARS-CoV-1 belonged to a distinct lineage from the two other HCoV known at the time [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
By July 2003, the SARS outbreak was officially determined to be under control, with the success credited to infection management practices [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
A decade later, a second outbreak of severe respiratory illness associated with a coronavirus emerged, this time in the Arabian Peninsula.
This disease, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), was linked to another novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV.
The fatality rate associated with MERS is much higher than that of SARS, at almost 35%, but the disease is much less easily transmitted, with an R~0~ of 1 [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Although MERS is still circulating, its low reproduction number has allowed for its spread to be contained [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
The COVID-19 pandemic is thus associated with the seventh HCoV to be identified and the fifth since the turn of the millennium, though additional HCoVs may be in circulation but remain undetected.

SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were ultimately managed largely through infection management practices (e.g., mask wearing) and properties of the virus itself (i.e., low rate of transmission), respectively [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81; @doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Vaccines were not used to control either virus, although vaccine development programs were established for SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.3390/v11010059].
In general, care for SARS and MERS patients focuses on supportive care and symptom management [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Clinical treatments for SARS and MERS developed during the outbreaks generally do not have strong evidence supporting their use.
Common treatments included Ribavirin, an antiviral, often in combination with corticosteroids or sometimes interferon (IFN) medications, which would both be expected to have immunomodulatory effects [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
However, retrospective and _in vitro_ analyses have reported inconclusive results of these treatments on SARS and the SARS-CoV-1 virus, respectively [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
IFNs and Ribavirin have shown promise in _in vitro_ analyses of MERS, but their clinical effectiveness remains unknown [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
Therefore, only limited strategy for the pharmaceutical management of COVID-19 can be adopted from previous severe HCoV infections.
Research in response to prior outbreaks of HCoV-borne infections, such as SARS and MERS, have, however, provided a strong foundation for hypotheses about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 as well as potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

<!-- TO DO: Which zoonotic viruses have been identified as likely relatives of SARS-CoV-2? How do we know this viral species evolved naturally (as opposed to the conspiracy theories? What differs between SARS-CoV-2 and its close relatives?-->

#### Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Variants

Evolution in SARS-CoV-2 has also been observed over a short timescale.
After zoonotic transfer, SARS-CoV-2 continued evolving in the human population [@doi:10.1186/s12967-020-02344-6].
The SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is moderate compared to other RNA viruses [@doi:10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104351], which likely restricts the pace of evolution in SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, genomic analyses have yielded statistical evidence of ongoing evolution.
There are two known variants of the spike protein that differ by a single amino acid at position 614 (G614 and D614), and there is evidence that G614 had become more prevalent than D614 by June 2020 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.043].
While there is a hypothesis that this genomic change increased the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and virulence, this hypothesis has not yet been tested due to a lack of data [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.040].
Another study [@doi:10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104351] identified 198 recurrent mutations in a dataset of 7,666 curated sequences.
This pattern of convergent evolution at some sites could indicate that certain mutations confer an adaptive advantage.
While it is evident that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits moderate potential for ongoing and future evolution, the relationship between mutations and pathogenicity is not yet known.
Additional data is needed in order to understand patterns of evolutionary change and whether they are likely to affect virulence.

Several factors could promote the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, including host immunodeficiency and transient exposure to antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. 
A single case study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunocompromised female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.049] suggested that an accelerated evolution of the virus could occur in conditions of immunodeficiency. 
A first administration of convalescent plasma did not clear the virus, and an ensuing increase in the genomic diversity in the samples was observed, suggesting an accelerated evolution due to selection pressure. 
A second administration of convalescent plasma cleared the virus from the host 105 days after the initial diagnosis. 
However, throughout the duration of infection, the patient was asymptomatic but contagious.
A second single case study in a 45-year old male with antiphospholipid syndrome [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2031364] confirmed the earlier results, providing evidence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms in an immunocompromised patient for 154 days following diagnosis, ultimately leading to the death of patient. 
The treatments administered included remdesivir and the Regeneron anti-spike protein antibody cocktail. 
Genomic analyses of the patient's nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed an accelerated evolution of the virus through mutations in the spike gene and the receptor-binding domain. 

In summary, these two case studies suggested an accelerated evolution and persistent shedding of the virus in conditions of immunodeficiency. 
In particular, the first case highlighted the role of convalescent plasma in creating escape variants. 
In fact, a study [@doi:10.1101/2020.12.28.424451] suggested that exposure to convalescent plasma in vitro could neutralize the virus after 7 days but after 45 days and up to 80 days, viral escape was promoted through mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). 
Taken together, these observations could bring crucial information about the conditions and the kinetics of the development of resistance in SARS-CoV-2 and its implications of the design of vaccine regimens or the need for next generation vaccines.

The evolved variants could occur by chance or through an adaptive process that confers a competitive advantage to the virus.
Variants that had the D614G mutation in the spike glycoprotein seemed to spread faster. 
However, it has been suggested that the mutation occurred by early chance events rather than by adaptive events [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.27124].
Another mutation, Y453F that occurred in the receptor binding domain of spike was first detected in mink, however, the transmission to humans has been established.
In mink, this mutation conferred an advantage by increasing the affinity towards ACE2 [@doi:10.1126/science.abe5901].
Similarly, N501Y mutation induces an increased affinity towards human ACE2 and has been involved in the dominance of B.1.1.7 by outcompeting other variants [@doi:10.1101/2020.12.24.20248822].
Therefore, genomic surveillance is essential to prevent the emergence of super-spreaders [@doi:10.1126/science.abf2946].

Emerging methods are being applied to this problem in an effort to understand which mutations are most likely to be of significant concern.
Novel machine learning methods were developed to predict the mutations in the sequence that promote viral escape.
While they preserve the pathogenicity of the virus, escape mutations change the virus's sequence to evade detection by the immune system. 
By using tools from natural language processing (NLP), viral escape was modeled as an NLP problem [@doi:10.1126/science.abd7331] where a modification makes a sentence grammatically correct but semantically different.
Therefore, language models of viruses could predict mutations that change the presentation of the virus to the immune system but preserve its infectivity.

### Conclusions

As of October 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a serious worldwide threat.
The scientific community has responded by rapidly collecting and disseminating information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated illness, COVID-19.
The rapid identification of the genomic sequence of the virus allowed for early contextualization of SARS-CoV-2 among other known respiratory viruses.
The pathogen is a coronavirus that is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, which caused the SARS pandemics of the early 2000s.
Knowing the phylogenetic context and genomic sequence of the virus then allowed for rapid insights into its structure and pathogenesis.
