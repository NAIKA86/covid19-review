## Dietary Supplements and Nutraceuticals Under Investigation for COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment

### Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused global disruption and a significant loss of life.
Scientists and physicians around the world have worked to discover and develop novel treatments or repurpose existing treatments in order to identify potential prophylactic and therapeutic agents to stem the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the devastation of this pandemic.
Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals are also being investigated in this context.
Despite a lack of evidence to support their efficacy or safety for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19, the beginning of the pandemic led to increased sales of vitamins, supplements, nutraceuticals, and various other products purporting 'immune-boosting' effects.
Considerable interest amongst the scientific community and emerging evidence has led to further investigation of these products. 
In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.
These include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), probiotics, and zinc.
These compounds were selected as they are currently under clinical investigation.
There is increasing evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial due to plausible associations between vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 incidence and possibly disease severity.
A growing number of scientific organizations are considering or advising for increased vitamin D supplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19.
Overall, caution is warranted as further evidence and clinical trials are required before conclusive evidence-based recommendations can be formulated for any specific dietary supplements or nutraceuticals.
Consumers should also be aware of misinformation and false promises surrounding some supplement products, which may lack safety and efficacy evidence due to poor regulation by authorities.
However, considering that nutritional status plays a significant role in patient outcomes, it would be pertinent to advise the general public to follow a healthy diet and lifestyle to prevent nutrient deficiencies and to maintain a healthy immune system.

### Importance

Sales of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals have increased since the start of the pandemic due to their perceived health benefits. 
These include vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc which are synonymous with the treatment of respiratory infections and supporting immune health.
However, little is known about the efficacy of these dietary supplements and nutraceuticals against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or the disease it causes, COVID-19.
This review provides a critical overview of the potential prophylactic and therapeutic value of various dietary supplements and nutraceuticals from the evidence available to date.
Evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with greater incidence of infection and severe COVID-19 and that vitamin D supplementation may be of prophylactic and therapeutic value.
However, considerably more research is required to determine whether dietary supplements and nutraceuticals exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic value against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. 

### Introduction

Scientists and the medical community are scrambling to repurpose or discover novel host-directed therapies as a result of the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Some successful therapies such as remdesivir and dexamethasone have been identified for hospitalized patients.
Furthermore, society has mostly adopted the non-pharmacological preventative public health strategies that reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 
However, many have sought additional protections via the consumption of various dietary supplements and nutraceuticals with purported beneficial effects.
Indeed, a patients nutritional status seems to play a role in COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes [@doi:10.3390/nu12051466; @doi:10.1101/2020.10.19.20214395; @doi:10.1093/advances/nmaa125; @doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.018; @doi:10.3390/nu12041181].
Nutraceuticals are classified as supplements with health benefits beyond their basic nutritional value [@doi:10.1080/10408390902841529; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
The key difference between a dietary supplement and a nutraceutical is that nutraceuticals should not only supplement the diet, but also aid in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of a disorder or disease [@doi:10.1208/ps050325].
For the general public in particular, whether nutraceuticals or dietary supplements can provide any prophylactic or therapeutic benefit has been a topic of interest.
Despite the lack of any evidence to support their use, the begining of the pandemic led sales of these products to soar. 
In the United States, dietary supplement and nutraceutical sales were worth $345 million for the entirety of 2019, whereas sales reached $435 million during the six-week period of the outbreak that ended on April 5 of 2020, which grew by a further $151 million by May 17 2020 [@url:https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/peak-dietary-supplement-sales-leveling-during-covid-19-pandemic-growth-still-remains-strong].
In France, New Zealand, India, and China similar trends in sales were reported [@doi:10.3390/nu12061699; @url:https://www.nutraingredients-asia.com/Article/2020/07/06/Lockdown-impact-Grocery-stores-bolstered-NZ-supplements-sales-as-pharmacies-slumped; @url:https://www.nutritioninsight.com/news/covid-19-temporarily-bolsters-european-interest-in-supplements.html; @url:https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2020/07/21/India-s-immune-health-surge-Nation-leads-APAC-in-number-of-new-product-launches-new-data].
The increase in sales was driven by a consumer perception that dietary supplements and nutraceuticals would protect consumers from infection and/or mitigate the impact of infection due to the various "immune-boosting" claims of these products [@doi:10.1016/j.tifs.2020.09.001; @url:https://kerry.com/insights/kerrydigest/2020/5-food-and-beverage-trends-in-europe-during-covid-19].

However, dietary supplements and nutraceuticals, unlike pharmaceuticals, do not follow the same regulatory protocols that protect consumers of medicines. 
Indeed, nutraceuticals do not entirely fall under the responsibility of the FDA, but they are monitored as dietary supplements according to the Dietary Supplement, Health and Education Act 1994 (DSHEA) [@url:https://ods.od.nih.gov/About/DSHEA_Wording.aspx] and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act 1997 (FDAMA) [@url:https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/selected-amendments-fdc-act/food-and-drug-administration-modernization-act-fdama-1997].
Due to the increased sales of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals, in 1996 the FDA established the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs (ODSP) to increase surveillance.
Novel products or nutraceuticals must now submit a new dietary ingredient notification to the ODSP for review.  
There are significant concern that these legislations do not adequately protect the consumer as they ascribe responsibility on the manufacturers to ensure the safety of the product before manufacturing or marketing [@doi:10.1080/17512433.2018.1464911].
Manufacturers are not required to register or even seek approval from the FDA to produce or sell food supplements or nutraceuticals.
Health or nutrient content claims for labeling purposes are approved based on an authoritative statement from the Academy of Sciences or relevant federal authorities once the FDA has been notified and on the basis that the information is known to be true and not deceptive [@doi:10.1080/17512433.2018.1464911]. 

In Europe, the safety of supplements are monitored by the European Union (EU) under Directive 2002/46/EC [@url:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32002L0046].
However, nutraceuticals are not directly mentioned.
Consequently, nutraceuticals can be generally described as either a medicinal product under Directive 2004/27/EC [@url:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0027] or as a 'foodstuff' under Directive 2002/46/EC of the European council.
In order to synchronize the various existing legislations, Regulation EC 1924/2006 on nutrition and health calims was put into effect to assure customers of safety and efficacy of products and to deliver understandable information to consumers.
However, specific legislation for nutraceuticals is still elusive.
Health claims are permitted on a product label only following compliance and authorization according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines on nutrition and health claims [@url:https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/claims/register/public].
EFSA does not currently distinguish between food supplements and nutraceuticals for health claim applications of new products, as claim authorization is dependent on the availability of clinical data in order to substantiate efficacy [@doi:10.1111/bcp.13496].
Howeverm, these guidelines seem to provide more protection to consumers than the FDA regulations, but potentially at the cost of innovation in the sector [@doi:10.1080/09637486.2016.1212816].
Looking further afield, the situation becomes even more complicated at a global level where countries such as China and India have existing regulatory frameworks for traditional medicines and phytomedicines not commonly consumed by Western society [@doi:10.3390/nu10010041]. 
Currently, there is a debate among scientists and regulatory authorities surrounding the development of a widespread regulatory framework to deal with the challenges of safety and health claim substantiation for nutraceuticals [@doi:10.1111/bcp.13496; @doi:10.1080/17512433.2018.1464911] as these products do not necessarily follow the same rigorous clinical trial frameworks used to approve the use of pharmaceuticals.

These regulatory disparities have been highlighted by the pandemic as many individuals and companies have attempted to profit from the vulnerabilities of others by overstating claims in relation to the treatment of COVID-19 using supplements and nutraceuticals. 
The FDA has written several letters to prevent companies marketing or selling products based on false hyperbolic promises to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or treat COVID-19 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/noetic-nutraceuticals-607572-05152020; @url:https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2020-S-0023-0068; @url:https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/spartan-enterprises-inc-dba-watershed-wellness-center-610876-10302020], some even charging the consumers $23,000 [@url:https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/07/ftc-sues-california-marketer-23000-covid-19-treatment-plan].
There has even been some incidences highlighted in the media because of their potentially life threatening consequences, for example the use of oleandrin was touted as a potential 'cure' by individuals close to the former President of the United States despite its high toxicity [@url:https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/natural-products/oleandrin-compound-touted-possible-COVID/98/web/2020/08].

Notwithstanding the issues of poor safety, efficacy, and regulatory oversight, some dietary supplements and nutraceuticals have exhibited therapeutic and prophylactic  potential. 
Some have been linked with reduced immunopathology, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities, or even the prevention of ARDS [@doi:10/ggkd3b; @doi:10.1016/j.tifs.2020.09.001; @doi:10.3390/nu12061718].
A host of potential candidates have been highlighted in the literature that target various aspects of the COVID-19 viral pathology, while others are thought to prime the host immune system.
These candidates include vitamins and minerals along with extracts and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707].
_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies suggest that nutraceuticals containing phycocyanobilin, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, selenium or phase 2 inductive nutraceuticals (e.g. ferulic acid, lipoic acid, or sulforaphane) can prevent or modulate RNA virus infections via amplification of the signaling activity of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and activation of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007].
While promising, further animal and human studies are required to assess the therapeutic potential of these various nutrients and nutraceuticals against COVID-19.
For the purpose of this review, we have highlighted some of the main dietary supplements and nutraceuticals that are currently under investigation for their potential prophylactic and therapeutic applications.
These include vitamins C and D, zinc, probiotics, and n-3 PUFA. 

### n-3 PUFA

One supplement that has been explored for beneficial effects against various viral infections is n-3 PUFA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707], such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
EPA and DHA intake can come from a diet high in fish or through dietary supplementation with fish oils or purified oils [@doi:10.1039/c9fo01742a].
Other more sustainable sources of EPA and DHA include algae [@doi:10.3389/fphys.2020.00752], which can also be exploited for their rich abundance of other bioactive compunds such as ACE inhibitor peptides and antiviral agents such as phycobiliproteins, sulfated polysaccharides, and calcium-spirulan [@doi:10.1016/j.nut.2020.111089].
They can mediate inflammation and therefore may have the capacity to modulate the adaptive immune response [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04374.x; @doi:10.1039/c9fo01742a; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
Another potential mechanism that has led to interest in n-3 PUFA for viral infections is its potential as a precursor molecule for the biosynthesis of endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPM), such as protectins and resolvins, that actively resolve inflammation and infection [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.02.009].
Finally, some COVID-19 patients, particularly those with comorbidities, are at a significant risk of thrombotic complications including arterial and venous thrombosis [@doi:10.1182/blood.2020006000; @doi:10.1007/s11239-020-02134-3].
Therefore, the use of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulants and antithrombotic agents is under consideration [@doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.031; @doi:10.3389/fnut.2020.583080], which could potentially include n-3 PUFA.

SPM have exhibited beneficial effects against a variety of lung infections, including some caused by RNA viruses [@doi:10.1038/nri.2015.4; @doi:10.1002/biof.1691].
Indeed, protectin D1 has been shown to increase survival from H1N1 viral infection in mice by affecting the viral replication machinery [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.027].
Several mechanisms for SPM have been proposed, including preventing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines or increasing phagocytosis of cellular debris by macrophages [@doi:10.1038/nature13479].
In influenza, SPM promote antiviral B lymphocytic activities [@doi:10.4049/jimmunol.1302795], and protectin D1 has been shown to increase survival from H1N1 viral infection in mice by affecting the viral replication machinery [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.027].
It is hypothesized that SPM could aid in the resolution of the cytokine storm and pulmonary inflammation associated with COVID-19 [@doi:10.1007/s10555-020-09889-4; @doi:10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110340].
Another theory is that some comorbidities such as obesity can lead to deficiencies of SPM that may be involved in the occurence of adverse outcomes for COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.3389%2Ffimmu.2020.01997]. 
However, not all studies are in agreement that n-3 PUFA or their resulting SPM are effective against infections [@doi:10.3945/jn.109.108027].
At a minimum, the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA against infections would be dependent on the dosage, timing, and the specific pathogens responsible [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2016.10.001].
On another level, there is still the question of whether fish oils can raise the levels of SPM levels upon ingestion and in response to acute inflammation in humans [@doi:10.1194/jlr.M060392].
Currently, Karolinska University Hospital is running a trial that will measure the levels of SPM as a secondary outcome following intravenous supplementation of n-3 PUFA in hospitalized COVID-19 patients to determine whether n-3 PUFA possess therapeutic value [@clinicaltrials:NCT04647604].

The increased risk of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 infected patients was reported relatively late in comparison to other manifestations of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013; @doi:10.1182/blood.2020006000].
Considering that there is significant evidence that n-3 fatty acids and other fish oil-derived lipids possess antithrombotic properties and anti-inflammatory properties [@doi:10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2018.09.005; @doi:10.1016/j.blre.2020.100694], they may have therapeutic value against the prothrombotic complications of COVID-19.
Based on concern among the medical community that the use of investigational therapeutics on COVID-19 patients already on antiplatelet therapies due to a pre-existing comorbidities may lead to issues with dosing and drug choice, and/or negative drug-drug interactions [@doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.031], this supplementation holds particular interest for the treatment of patients already receiving pharmaceutical antiplatelet therapies.
As a result, the use of other therapeutics, such as dietary sources of n-3 fatty acids or nutraceuticals with antiplatelet activities, may be beneficial and warrant further investigation.
A new clinical trial [@clinicaltrials:NCT04412018] is currently recruiting COVID-19 positive patients to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of a recently developed, highly purified nutraceutical derivative of EPA known as icosapent ethyl (Vascepa^TM^) [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1812792].
Other randomized controlled trials are in the preparatory stages with the intention of investigating the administration of EPA and other bioactive compounds to COVID-19 positive patients to determine whether anti-inflammatory effects or disease state improvements are observed [@clinicaltrials:NCT04335032; @clinicaltrials:NCT04323228].
Finally, while there have been studies investigating the therapeutic value of n-3 fatty acids against ARDS in humans, there is still limited evidence of their effectiveness [@doi:10.3390/ijms21093104].
It should be noted that the overall lack of human studies in this area means there is limited evidence as to whether these supplements could affect COVID-19 infection.
Consequently, clinical trials have been proposed and many are in the preparatory stages.
These trials will investigate whether the anti-inflammatory potential of n-3 PUFA and their derivatives is beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
Therefore, the evidence is not present to draw conclusions about whether n-3 PUFA will be useful in treating COVID-19, but as there is likely little harm associated with a diet rich in fish oils, interest in these products by the general public is unlikely to have negative effects.

### Zinc

There is evidence that certain nutrient supplements may exhibit some benefit against RNA viral infections.
Zinc is a trace metal obtained from dietary sources or supplementation that is important for the maintenance of immune cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc supplements can be administered orally as a tablet or as a lozenge and they are available in many forms, such as zinc picolinate, zinc acetate, and zinc citrate.
Zinc is also available from dietary sources including meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, legumes, and dairy.
The role of zinc in immune function has been extensively reviewed [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc is an important signaling molecule and zinc levels can alter host defense systems.
In inflammatory situations such as an infection, zinc can regulate leukocyte immune responses and it can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), thus altering cytokine production [@doi:10.4049/jimmunol.179.6.4180; @doi:10.1067/mlc.2001.118108].
In particular, zinc supplementation can increase natural killer cell levels, which are important cells for host defense against viral infections [@doi:10.1126/science.1198687; @doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].

Adequate zinc intake has been associated with reduced incidence of infection [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837] and antiviral immunity [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmz013].
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that administered zinc supplementation to elderly subjects over the course of a year found zinc deficiency to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection and that zinc deficiency could be prevented through supplementation [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837].
Clinical trial data supports the utility of zinc to diminish the duration and severity of symptoms associated with common colds when it is provided within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms [@doi:10.1331/1544-3191.44.5.594.Hulisz; @doi:10.2174/1874306401105010051].
An observational study has shown that COVID-19 patients had significantly lower zinc levels in comparison to healthy controls, they also tended to have more complications (70.4% vs 30.0%, _p_ = 0.009), and potentially prolonged hospital stays (7.9 vs 5.7 days, _p_ = 0.048) [@doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.014].  
In coronaviruses specifically, _in vitro_ evidence demonstrates that the combination of zinc (Zn2+) and zinc ionophores (pyrithione) can interrupt the replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-GFP (a fluorescently tagged SARS-CoV-1) and a variety of other RNA viruses [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.015].
Currently, there are over twenty clinical trials registered with the intention to use zinc in a preventative or therapeutic manner.
However, many of these trials proposed the use of zinc in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [@clinicaltrials:NCT04370782; @clinicaltrials:NCT04377646; @clinicaltrials:NCT04395768; @clinicaltrials:NCT04373733], and it is not known how the lack of evidence supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine will affect investigation of zinc.
One retrospective observational study of NYU Lagone hospitals in New York compared outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients administered hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with zinc sulphate (n = 411) versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone (n = 521).
While the addition of zinc sulphate did not affect the duration of hospitalization, the length of ICU stays or patient ventilation duration, univariate analyses demonstrated that zinc did increase the frequency of patients discharged and decreased the requirement for ventilation and referrals to the ICU, and reduced mortality [@doi:10.1099/jmm.0.001250]. 
However, a smaller retrospective study at Hoboken University Medical Center New Jersey failed to observe an association between zinc supplementation and survival of hospitalized patients [@doi:10.1016/j.chest.2020.06.082].

Other trials, however, are investigating zinc in conjunction with other supplements such as vitamin C or n-3 PUFA [@clinicaltrials:NCT04342728; @clinicaltrials:NCT04323228].
Though there is, overall, encouraging data for zinc supplementation against the common cold and viral infections, there is currently limited evidence to suggest zinc supplementation has any beneficial effects against the current novel COVID-19; thus, the clinical trials that are currently underway will provide vital information on the efficacious use of zinc in COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment.
However, given the limited risk, maintaining a healthy diet to ensure an adequate zinc status may be advisable for individuals seeking to reduce their likelihood of infection.

### Vitamin C

Vitamins B, C, D, and E have also been suggested as potential nutrient supplement interventions for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707; @doi:10.20944/preprints202003.0347.v1].
In particular vitamin C has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent against COVID-19 due to its long history of use against the common cold and other respiratory infections [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.574029; @doi:10.3390/nu12113286].
Vitamin C can be obtained via dietary sources such as fruit and vegetables or via supplementation.
Vitamin C plays a significant role in promoting immune function due to its effects on various immune cells.
It affects inflammation by modulating cytokine production, decreasing histamine levels, enhancing the differentiation and proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes, increasing antibody levels, and protecting against the negative effects of reactive oxygen species amongst other effects related to COVID-19 pathology [@doi:10.1155/2014/426740; @doi:10.1007/s00210-013-0880-1; @doi:10.3390/nu9111211].
Vitamin C is utilized by the body during viral infections, as evinced by lower concentrations in leukocytes and lower concentrations of urinary vitamin C.
Post-infection, these levels return to baseline ranges [@doi:10.1177/003693307301800102; @doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1975.tb29312.x; @doi:10/fd22sv; @doi:10.3390/nu9040339; @doi:10.1079/bjn19920004].
Indeed, COVID-19 patients appear to be deficient in vitamin C [@doi:10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100064; @doi:10.1186/s13054-020-03249-y]. 
COVID-19 is also associated with the formation of microthrombi and coagulopathy [@doi:10.1172/JCI140183] that contributes to the observed lung pathology [@doi:10.1183/16000617.0240-2020], which can be ameliorated by early infusions of vitamin C by inhibiting endothelial surface P-selectin expression and platelet-endothelial adhesion [@doi:10.3390/antiox6030049].
Indeed, intravenous vitamin C also reduced D-dimer levels in a case study of 17 COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1080/14787210.2020.1794819].

A recent meta-analysis found consistent support for regular vitamin C supplementation reducing the duration of the common cold, but that supplementation with vitamin C (> 200 mg) failed to reduce the incidence of colds [@doi:10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4].
Individual studies have found Vitamin C to reduce the susceptibility of patients to lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia [@doi:10.1097/00006454-199709000-00003].
Another meta-analysis has demonstrated in twelve trials that vitamin C supplementation reduced the length of stay of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) by 7.8% (95% CI: 4.2% to 11.2%; _p_ = 0.00003).
Furthermore, high doses (1-3 g/day) significantly reduced the length of an ICU stay by 8.6% in six trials (_p_ = 0.003).
Vitamin C also shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation by 18.2% in three trials in which patients required intervention for over 24 hours (95% CI 7.7% to 27%; p = 0.001) [@doi:10.3390/nu11040708].
Despite these findings, the CITRUS ALI study failed to show a benefit of a 96-hour infusion of vitamin C to treat ARDS, which is a severe complication of COVID-19 infection [@doi:10.1001/jama.2019.11825].
Nevertheless, clinical trials have begun as highlighted by Carr et al. [@doi:10.3390/nu12113286], the first of which was initiated in Wuhan China and the others will be conducted in Canada, China, Iran, and the USA. 
These trials intend to investigate the use of intravenous vitamin C in hostpitalized COVID-19 patients.
The first trial established in Wuhan China [@doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039519] has reported initial results indicating that 12 g/12 hr of intravenous vitamin C for 7 days in 56 critically ill COVID-19 patients resulted in a promising reduction of 28-day mortality (_p_ = 0.06) in univariate survival analysis [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-52778/v2]. 
Indeed, the same study reported a significant decrease in IL-6 levels by day 7 of vitamin C infusion (_p_ = 0.04) [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-52778/v1].

Even though evidence supporting the use of vitamin C is beginning to emerge, we will not know how effective vitamin C is as a therapeutic for quite some time.
Currently (as of December 2020) over fifteen trials are registered with clinicaltrials.gov that are either recruiting, active or are currently in preparation.
When completed, these trials will provide crucial evidence on the efficacy of vitamin C as a therapeutic for COVID-19 infection.
However, the majority of supplementation studies investigate the intravenous infusion of vitamin C in severe patients. 
Therefore, there is a lack of studies investigating the potential prophylactic administration of vitamin C via oral supplementation for healthy individuals or potentially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.
Once again, vitamin C intake is part of a healthy diet and the vitamin likely presents minimal risk, but its potential prophylactic or therapeutic effects against COVID-19 are yet to be determined.

### Vitamin D

Of all of the supplements currently under investigation, vitamin D has become a leading prophylactic and therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV-2.
Vitamin D can modulate both the adaptive and innate immune system and is associated with various aspects of immune health and antiviral defense [@doi:10.3390/nu9070651; @doi:10.3390/ijms19082419; @doi:10.3390/nu12072097; @doi:10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04001.x; @doi:10.1016/j.ecl.2017.07.010].
Vitamin D can be sourced through diet or supplementation, but it is mainly biosynthesized by the body on exposure to ultraviolet light (UVB) from sunlight.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755].
In particular, vitamin D deficient patients are at risk of developing acute respiratory infections [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017] and ARDS [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017].
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the active form of vitamin D that is involved in adaptive and innate responses, however, due to its low concentration and a short half life of a few hours, it is measured by its longer lasting more abundant precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 
The vitamin D receptor is expressed in various immune cells and vitamin D is an immunomodulator of antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and T- and B-lymphocytes [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755; @doi:10.1016/j.coph.2010.04.001].
Due to its potential immunomodulating properties, vitamin D supplementation may be advantageous to maintain a healthy immune system.

Early in the pandemic it was postulated that an individual’s vitamin D status may significantly affect their risk of developing COVID-19 [@doi:10.3390/nu12040988].
This hypothesis was derived from the fact that the current pandemic emerged in winter in Wuhan China when 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are at their lowest due to a lack of sunlight, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, where it was nearing the end of the summer and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations would be higher, the number of cases was low.
This led researchers to question whether there was a seasonal component to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and if vitamin D levels may play a role [@doi:10.3390/nu12040988; @doi:10.1111/joim.13149; @doi:10.1016/j.ajic.2020.06.193; @doi:10.1111/apt.15777].
Though it is assumed that COVID-19 is seasonal, multiple other factors that can affect vitamin D levels should also be considered.
These factors include an individual’s nutritional status, their age, their occupation, skin pigmentation, potential comorbidities, and the variation of exposure to sunlight due to latitude amongst others.
Indeed, it has been estimated that for each degree of latitude north of 28 degrees there was a 4.4% increase of COVID-19 mortality, indirectly linking a persons vitamin D levels via exposure to UVB light to COVID-19 mortality [@doi:10.1111/joim.13149]. 

As the pandemic evolves, further research of varying quality has investigated some of the potential links identified early in the pandemic [@doi:10.3390/nu12040988] between vitamin D and COVID-19. 
Indeed, studies are beginning to investigate whether there is any prophylactic and/or therapeutic relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19.
A study in Switzerland demonstrated that 27 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibited 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma concentrations that were significantly lower (11.1 ng/ml) than those of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (24.6 ng/ml; _p_ = 0.004), an association that held when stratifying for patients greater than 70 years old [@doi:10.3390/nu12051359].
These findings seem to be supported by a Belgian observational study of 186 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibiting symptoms of pneumonia, where 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma concentrations were measured and a CT scan of the lungs was obtained upon hospitalization [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376].
A significant difference in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was observed between the SARS-CoV-2 patients and 2,717 season-matched diseased controls.
Both female and male patients possessed lower median 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations than the control group (18.6 ng/ml versus 21.5 ng/ml; _p_ = 0.0016) and a higher rate of vitamin D deficiency (58.6% versus 42.5%).
Evidence of sexual dimorphism was also apparent, as female patients had equivalent levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the control group, whereas male patients were deficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D relative to male controls (67% versus 49%; _p_ = 0.0006).
Notably, vitamin D deficiency was progressively lower in males with advancing radiological disease stages (_p_ = 0.001).
These studies are supported by several others that indicate that vitamin D status may be an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0239799; @doi:10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.021; @doi:10.1111/febs.15495; @doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19722] and in COVID-19 patients relative to population-based controls [@doi:10.1210/clinem/dgaa733].
Indeed, serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/ml, which indicate vitamin D sufficiency, seems to be associated with a reduction in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, along with increased lymphocyte levels, which suggests that vitamin D levels may modulate the immune response by reducing risk for cytokine storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [@doi:10.1210/clinem/dgaa733].
A study in India has determined that COVID-19 fatality is higher in patients with severe COVID-19 and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (mean level 6.2 ng/ml; 97% vitamin D deficient) levels versus asymptomatic non-severe patients with higher levels of vitamin D (mean level 27.9 ng/ml; 33% vitamin D deficient) [@doi:10.1038/s41598-020-77093-z]. 
In the same study, vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers including IL-6, ferritin, and TNFa.
Collectively, these studies add to a multitude of observational studies reporting potential associations between low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and COVID-19 incidence and severity [@doi:10.3390/nu12051359; @doi:10.3390/nu12123773; @doi:10.1007/s40618-020-01370-x; @doi:10.1210/clinem/dgaa733; @doi:10.3390/nu12092757; @doi:10.3390/nu12092775; @doi:10.1080/07315724.2020.1826005; @doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19722; @doi:10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107001; @doi:10.1093/jn/nxaa332].

Despite these studies establishing a link between vitamin D status with COVID-19 severity, an examination of the UK Biobank did not support this thesis [@doi:10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.050; @doi:10.1007/s00394-020-02372-4].
These analyses examined 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations  and SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 mortality in over 340,000 UK Biobank participants.
However, these studies has caused considerable debate that will likely be settled following further studies [@doi:10.1111/cen.14276; @doi:10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.046].
Overall, the evidence suggest that there is likely a link between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and COVID-19 incidence, these studies must be interpreted with caution as there is the potential for reverse causality, bias, and other confounding factors including that vitamin D deficiency is also associated with numerous pre-existing conditions and risk factors that can increase the risk for severe COVID-19 [@doi:10.3390/nu12051466; @doi:10.1038/s41371-020-00398-z; @doi:10.1111/joim.13149; @doi:10.1007/s40520-020-01677-y].   

While these studies inform us of the potential importance of vitamin D sufficiency and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19, they fail to conclusively determine whether vitamin D supplementation can therapeutically affect the clinical course of COVID-19.
In one study, 40 vitamin D deficient asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic participants patients were either randomized to receive 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol daily for at least 7 days (n = 16) or a placebo (n = 24) with a target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level >50 ng/ml.
At day 7, 10 patients achieved >50 ng/ml, and another 2 by day 14.
By the end of the study, the treatment group had a greater proportion of vitamin D-deficient participants that turned SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative and they had a significantly lower fibrinogen levels potentially indicating a beneficial effect [@doi:10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139065].
A pilot study in Spain determined that early high dose calcifediol (~21,000 IU days 1-2 and ~11,000 IU days 3-7 of hospital admission) with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to 50 hospitalized COVID-19 patients significantly reduced ICU admissions and may have reduced disease severity versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2020.105751].  
While this study received significant criticism the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK [@url:https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/es28/chapter/Key-messages], an independent follow-up statistical analysis supported the findings of the study as a result of cholecalciferol treatment [@doi:10.1101/2020.11.08.20222638]. 
Another trial of 986 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in three UK hospitals, administered cholecalciferol supplementation (≥ 280,000 IU in a time period of 7 weeks) to 151 patients, which was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality regardless of baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [@doi:10.3390/nu12123799].
Juxtaposed, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 240 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Sao Paulo Brazil administered a single 200,000 IU oral dose of vitamin D. 
While levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D did increase from 21% to ~27% (_p_ = 0.001) and were well tolerated, there was no reduction in the length of hospital stay, mortality, and no change to any other relevant secondary outcomes [@doi:10.1101/2020.11.16.20232397].
These early findings are still inconclusive with regards to the therapeutic value of vitamin D supplementation.
However, other trials are underway including one trial that is investigating the utility of vitamin D as an immune-modulating agent by monitoring whether administration of vitamin D precipitates an improvement of health status in non-severe symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 or whether vitamin D prevents patient deterioration [@clinicaltrials:NCT04334005].
Other trials are examining various factors including mortality, symptom recovery, severity of disease, rates of ventilation, inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6, blood cell counts, and the prophylactic capacity of vitamin D administration [@clinicaltrials:NCT04385940; @clinicaltrials:NCT04334005; @clinicaltrials:NCT04411446; @clinicaltrials:NCT04344041].
Concomitant administration of vitamin D with pharmaceuticals such as aspirin [@clinicaltrials:NCT04363840] and bioactive molecules such as resveratrol [@clinicaltrials:NCT04400890] are also under investigation.

The effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19 remains open for debate.
Yet, there is no doubt that vitamin D deficiency is a widespread issue and should be mitigated for not only because of its potential link to SARS-CoV-2 incidence [@doi:10.1530/eje-18-0736], but also due to its importance for overall health.
There is a possibility that safe exposure to sunlight could improve endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, potentially strengthening the immune system. 
However, sun exposure is not sufficient on its own, particularly in the winter months.
Indeed, premptive supplementation of vitamin D and encouraging people to maintain a healthy diet for optimum vitamin D status is likely to raise serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D but it is unlikely to carry major health risks while the possible link between vitamin D status and COVID-19 is further investigated.
These principals seem to be the basis of a number of guidelines issued by some countries and scientific organizations that have advised supplementation of vitamin D during the pandemic.  
The Académie Nationale de Médecine in France recommends rapid testing of 25-hydroxyvitamin D for people over 60 years old to identify those most at risk of vitamin D deficiency and advising them to obtain a bolus dose of 50,000 to 100,000 IU vitamin D to limit respiratory complications. 
They have also recommended that those under 60 years old should take 800 to 1,000 IU daily if they upon a SARS-CoV-2 positive test [@url:https://www.academie-medecine.fr/communique-de-lacademie-nationale-de-medecine-vitamine-d-et-covid-19/].
Both Public Health England and Public Health Scotland have advised members of the black, asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities to supplement for vitamin D in light of evidence that they may be at higher risk for vitamin D deficiency and other COVID-19 risk factors.
Indeed, African Americans may have up to a 6-fold higher COVID-19 mortality rate than white populations [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6548; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m2475; @doi:10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000096].
However, other UK scientific bodies including the NICE recommends that individuals supplement for vitamin D as per usual UK government advice, but they warn that people should not supplement for vitamin D solely to prevent COVID-19. 
However, the NICE have provided guidelines for research to investigating the supplementation of vitamin D in the context of COVID-19 [@url:https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng187/resources/covid19-rapid-guideline-vitamin-d-pdf-66142026720709]. 
In Slovenia, doctors have been advised to provide nursing home patients with vitamin D [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m1820].
Despite vitamin D deficiency being a widespread issue in the United States [@doi:10.7759/cureus.2741] the National Institutes of Health have stated that there is "insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19"
[@url:https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/adjunctive-therapy/vitamin-d/].
These are just some examples of how public health guidance has responded to the emerging evidence with regards to vitamin D and COVID-19.
However, some companies have used the evidence surrounding vitamin D to sell products that claim to prevent and treat COVID-19, which in one incidence has required a federal court to intervene and issue an injunction barring the sale of vitamin D related products due to a lack of clinical data to support their claims [@url:https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/court-orders-georgia-defendants-stop-selling-vitamin-d-products-treatments-covid-19-and-other]
It it clear that further studies and clinical trials are required to conclusively determine the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19.
Unitl such time that sufficient evidence emerges, individuals should follow their national guidelines surrounding vitamin D intake to achieve vitamin D sufficiency.

### Probiotics

Probiotics are “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” [@doi:10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66].
Some studies suggest that probiotics are beneficial against common viral infections and there is modest evidence to suggest that they can modulate the immune response [@doi:10.4082/kjfm.2013.34.1.2; @doi:10.2174/1381612824666180116163411], and as a result it has been hypothesized that probiotics may have therapeutic value worthy of investigation against SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.3389/fpubh.2020.00186].
Probiotics and next-generation probiotics, which are more akin to pharmacological-grade supplements, have been associated with multiple potential beneficial effects for allergies, digestive tract disorders, and even metabolic diseases through their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [@doi:10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.57; @doi:10.1093/advances/nmy063].
However, the mechanisms by which probiotics affect these various conditions would likely differ among strains, with the ultimate effect of the probiotic depending on the heterogeneous set of bacteria present [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmy063].
Some of the beneficial effects of probiotics include reducing inflammation by promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, inhibiting toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, direct competition with pathogens, the synthesis of antimicrobial substances or other metabolites, improving intestinal barrier function, and/or favorably altering the gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis [@doi:10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2019.05.010; @doi:10.1093/advances/nmy063; @doi:10.1159/000342079].
It is also thought that lactobacilli such as _Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum_ and _Lactobacillus rhamnosus_ have the capacity to bind and inactivate some viruses via adsoptive and/or trapping mechanisms [@doi:10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.10.044].
Other probiotic lactobacilli and even non-viable bacterium-like particles have been shown to reduce viral attachment to host cells and reduce viral titers, reduce cytokine synthesis, enhance the antiviral IFN-α response along with inducing various other antiviral mechanisms  [@doi:10.1111/lam.12160; @doi:10.1016/j.anaerobe.2011.04.022; @doi:10.4049/jimmunol.1800927; @doi:10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.10.044; @doi:10.3390/medicina55090519; @doi:10.1038/s41598-019-39602-7; @doi:10.3920/bm2016.0160; @doi:10.3389%2Ffimmu.2020.00015; @doi:10.1016/j.intimp.2013.12.020; @doi:10.1016/j.intimp.2019.106115].
These antiviral and immunobiotic mechanisms and more have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [@doi:10.3390/nu12061718; @doi:10.1038/s41538-020-00078-9; @doi:10.3389/fpubh.2020.00186]. 
However, there is also a bi-directional relationship between the lungs and gut microbiota known as the gut-lung axis [@doi:10.1038/mi.2011.55], whereby gut microbial metabolites and endotoxins may affect the lungs via the circulatory system and the lung microbiota in return may affect the gut [@doi:10.1111/cmi.12966].
Therefore, the gut-lung axis may play role in our future understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and become a target for probiotic treatments [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198018].
Moreover, as microbial dysbiosis of the respiratory tract and gut may play a role in some viral infections, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with our commensal microbiota [@doi:10.3390/nu12061718; @doi:10.3389/fmicb.2020.01840; 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01840] and that the lung microbiome could play a role in developing immunity to viral infections [@doi:10.1016/j.humic.2020.100073].
These postulations, if correct, could lead to the development of novel probiotic and prebiotic treatments. 
However, significant research is required to confirm these associations and their relevance to patient care, if any. 

Probiotics have tentatively been associated with the reduction of risk and duration of viral upper respiratory tract infections [@doi:10.1007/s10096-014-2086-y; @doi:10.1002/14651858.CD006895.pub3; @doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.11.005].
Some meta-analyses that have assessed the efficacy of probiotics in viral respiratory infections have reported moderate reductions in the incidence and duration of infection [@doi:10.1002/14651858.CD006895.pub3; @doi:10.1017/S0007114514000075].
Indeed, randomized controlled trials have shown that administering _Bacillus subtilis_ and _Enterococcus faecalis_ [@doi:10.1007/s00134-016-4303-x], _Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG_ [@doi:10.1164/rccm.200912-1853OC], or _Lactobacillus casei_ and _Bifidobacterium breve_ with galactooligosaccharides [@doi:10.1186/s13054-018-2167-x] via the nasogastric tube to ventilated patients reduced the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in comparison to the respective control groups in studies of viral infections and sepsis.
These findings are supported by a recently published meta-analysis [@doi:10.4187/respcare.07097].
There is a significant risk of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.12340496], but it can be challenging for clinicians to diagnose this infection due to the fact that severe COVID-19 infection presents with the symptoms of pneumonia [@doi:10.1186/s13054-020-03013-2].
Therefore, an effective prophylactic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in severe COVID-19 patients would be of significant therapeutic value.

Probiotics are generally synonymous with the treatment of gastrointestinal issues due to their supposed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [@doi:10/d2qp].
Notably, gastrointestinal symptoms commonly occur in COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.020], and the ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in enterocytes of the ileum and colon, suggesting that these organs may be a potential route of infection [@doi:10.1101/2020.01.30.927806; @doi:10.1038/cr.2016.152].
Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in human feces [@doi:10/ggq8zp; @doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.055], and fecal-oral transmission of the virus has not yet been ruled out [@doi:10/ggpx7s].
Rectal swabs of some SARS-CoV-2 positive pediatric patients persistently tested positive for several days despite negative nasopharyngeal tests, indicating the potential for fecal viral shedding [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0817-4].
However, there is conflicting evidence for the therapeutic value of various probiotics against the incidence or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in viral or bacterial infections such as gastroenteritis [@doi:10.1007/s00203-017-1400-3; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1802597].
Nevertheless, it has been proposed that the administration of probiotics to COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers may prevent or ameliorate the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19, a hypothesis that several clinical trials are now preparing to investigate [@clinicaltrials:NCT04420676; @clinicaltrials:NCT04366180].
Other studies are investigating whether probiotics may affect patient outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection [@clinicaltrials:NCT04390477].

Generally, the efficacy of probiotic use is a controversial topic among scientists.
In Europe, EFSA has banned the term probiotics on products labels, which has elicited either criticism for EFSA or support for probiotics from researchers in the field [@doi:10.1016/j.bpg.2015.12.001; @doi:10.1017/S000711451100287X; @doi:10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66].
This is due to the hyperbolic claims placed on the labels of various probiotic products, which lack rigorous scientific data to support their efficacy.
Overall, the data supporting probiotics in the treatment or prevention of many different disorders and diseases is not conclusive as the quality of the evidence is generally considered low [@doi:10.1007/s10096-014-2086-y].
However, in the case of probiotics and respiratory infections, the evidence seems to be supportive of their potential therapeutic value.
Consequently, several investigations are underway to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of probiotics for COVID-19.
However, blind use of conventional probiotics for COVID-19 is cautioned against until the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is further established [@doi:10/d2qq].
Until clinical trials investigating the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of probiotics for COVID-19 are complete, it is not possible to provide an evidence-based recommendation for their use.
Despite these concerns, complementary use of probiotics as an adjuvant therapeutic has been proposed by the Chinese National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine [@doi:10.1111/1751-2980.12851]. 

### Discussion

The purported prophylactic and therapeutic benefits of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for multiple disorders, diseases, and infections has been the subject of significant research and debate for the last few decades. 
Inevitably, scientists are also investigating the potential of these various products to treat or prevent COVID-19.
This interest also extends to consumers, which led to a remarkable increase of sales of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals throughout the pandemic due to a desire to obtain additional protections from infection and disease.
It is pertinent to clarify that the nutraceuticals discussed in this review, namely vitamin C, vitamin D, n-3 PUFA, zinc, and probiotics, have been selected because of their possible relevance to the biological mechanisms that can beneficially affect viral and respiratory infections and because they are currently under clinical investigation.
However, there are various other products and molecules that have garnered scientific interest and are under further investigation. 
These include polyphenols, lipid extracts, and tomato-based nutraceuticals among others, which have all been suggested for the prevention of potential cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 such as thrombosis [@doi:10.3389/fnut.2020.583080; @doi:10.3390/nu12061718].
These are just some of the many substances and supplements under investigation that currently have limited evidence to support their use or supplementation with the aim to prevent or treat COVID-19.
Melatonin is another supplement that has been identified as a potential antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 using computational methods [@doi:10.1038/s41421-020-0153-3] and it has also been highlighted as a potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19 due to its documented antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10.3389/fnut.2020.583080; @doi:10.3390/antiox10010047; @doi:10.3390/nu13010047].
Notably, melatonin, vitamin D and zinc were included in the treatment plan of the Former President of the United States upon hospitalization due to COVID-19 [@doi:10.1126/science.abf0974].
While there is plenty speculation surrounding the use of supplements, a survey of 327,720 users of the COVID Symptom Study App found that the consumption of n-3 PUFA supplements, probiotics, multivitamins, and vitamin D was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in women but not men after adjusting for potential confounders [@doi:10.1101/2020.11.27.20239087].
According to the authors, the sexual dimorphism observed may in part be because supplements may better support females due to known differences between the male and female immune systems or it could be due to behavioural and health consciousness differences between the sexes [@doi:10.1101/2020.11.27.20239087].
Certainly, randomized controlled trials are required to investigate these findings further.

In this review, we report the findings to date for several dietary supplements and nutraceuticals.
While existng evidence suggests potential benefits of n-3 PUFA and probiotic supplementation for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis, clinical data is lacking but trials are underway.
Both zinc and vitamin C supplementation in hospitalized patients seem to be associated with positive outcomes, however, further clinical trials are required. 
In any case, both vitamin C and zinc intake are part of a healthy diet and both likely presents minimal risk when supplemented for, but their potential prophylactic or therapeutic effects against COVID-19 are yet to be determined.
On the other hand, mounting evidence from observational studies indicates that there is an association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 incidence, which is supported by meta-analysis [@doi:10.1080/10408398.2020.1841090].
Indeed, scientists are working to affirm these findings and to determine whether a patients serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are also associated with COVID-19 severity.
Clinical trials are required to determine whether preemptive vitamin D supplementation may mitigate against severe COVID-19.
In terms of the therapeutic potential of vitamin D, initial evidence from clinical trials are conflicting, but seem to indicate that vitamin D supplementation may reduce COVID-19 severity [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2020.105751].
The various clinical trials currently underway will be imperative to provide information on the efficacious use of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment.

Finally, it is known that a patient's nutritional status affects health outcomes in various infectious diseases [@doi:10.3390/nu12041181], and COVID-19 is no different [@doi:10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022; @doi:10.1093/advances/nmaa125; @doi:10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.09.214]. 
Some of the main risk factors for severe COVID-19, which also happen to be linked to poor nutritional status includes obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes mellitus, and indeed age-related malnutrition [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmaa125; @doi:10.3390/nu12051466; @doi:10.1002/jpen.1954].
Although not the main focus of this review, it is important to consider the nutritional challenges associated with severe COVID-19 patients.
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to report an unusually high loss of appetite preceeding admission, some suffer diarrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms in hospital resulting in significantly lower food intake, and patients with poorer nutritional status were more likely to have worse outcomes and require nutrition therapy [@doi:10.1002/jpen.1953].
Dysphagia also seems to be a significant problem in rehabilitating COVID-19 patients, potentially contributing to poor nutritional status [@doi:10.1038/s41430-020-0664-x]. 
Almost two-thirds of discharged COVID-19 ICU patients exhibit significant weight loss, of which 26% had weight loss greater than 10% [@doi:10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.09.214].
As investigated in this review, hospitalized patients also tend to exhibit vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, which may be associated with greater disease severity [@doi:10.1080/10408398.2020.1841090].
Therefore, further research is required to determine how dietary supplements and nutraceuticals may contribute to the treatment of severely ill and rehabilitating patients who often rely on enteral nutrition.

### Conclusions

Despite all the potential benefits of nutraceutical and dietary supplement interventions presented, currently there is a paucity of clinical evidence to support their use for the prevention or mitigation of COVID-19 infection.
Nevertheless, optimal nutritional status can prime an individual’s immune system to protect against the effects of acute respiratory viral infections by supporting normal maintenance of the immune system [@doi:10.3390/nu12041181; @doi:10.3390/nu12051466].
Nutritional strategies can also play a role in the treatment of hospitalized patients, as malnutrition is a risk to COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1038/s41430-020-0664-x].
Overall, supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may be an effective method of ensuring their adequate intake to maintain optimal immune function, which may also convey beneficial effects against viral infections due to their immunomodulatory effects.
Individuals should pay attention to their nutritional status, particulalry their intake of vitamin D, considering its deficiency tends to be widespread.
The prevailing evidence seems to indicate an association between vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 incidence and potentially its severity [https:10.1111/joim.13149].
As a result, some international authorities have advised the general public, particularly those at high risk of infection, to consider vitamin supplementation.
However, further well-controlled clinical trials are required to confirm the observations presented in this review.
Many supplements and nutraceuticals designed for various ailments are available in the United States and beyond that are not strictly regulated [@doi:10.1080/10408398.2019.1592107].
Consequently, there can be safety and efficacy concerns associated with many of these products.
Often, the vulnerable members of society can be exploited in this regard and unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic is no different.
As aforementioned, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings to several companies for advertising falsified claims in relation to the preventative and therapeutic capabilities of their products against COVID-19 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-update-fda-and-ftc-warn-seven-companies-selling-fraudulent-products-claim-treat-or].
Further intensive investigation is required to establish the effects of these nutraceuticals, if any, against COVID-19.
Until more effective therapeutics are established, the most effective mitigation strategies consist of encouraging standard public health practices such as regular hand washing with soap, wearing a face mask, and covering a cough with your elbow [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html], along with following social distancing measures, "shelter in place" guidelines, expansive testing, and contact tracing [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.27.20045815; @doi:10.3201/eid2608.201093].
Indeed, in light of this review, it would also be pertinent to adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle following national guidelines in order to maintain optimal immune health.
