## Nutraceuticals

### Abstract

### Introduction

Given the current pandemic, scientists and the medical community are scrambling to repurpose or discover novel host-directed therapies.
For the general public in particular, whether nutraceuticals or dietary supplements can provide any prophylactic or therapeutic benefit has been a topic of interest.
Nutraceuticals are classified as supplements with health benefits beyond their basic nutritional value [@doi:10.1080/10408390902841529; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
The key difference between a dietary supplement and a nutraceutical is that nutraceuticals should not only supplement the diet, but also aid in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of a disorder or disease [@doi:10.1208/ps050325].
In the United States, dietary supplement and nutraceutical sales were worth $345 million for the entirety of 2019, whereas sales reached $435 million during the six-week period of the outbreak that ended on April 5 of 2020, which grew by a further $151 million by May 17 2020 [@url:https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/peak-dietary-supplement-sales-leveling-during-covid-19-pandemic-growth-still-remains-strong].
The increase in sales was driven by a consumer perception that dietary supplements and nutraceuticals would protect consumers from infection and/or mitigate the impact of infection due to the various "immune-boosting" claims of these various products [@doi:10.1016/j.tifs.2020.09.001; @url:https://kerry.com/insights/kerrydigest/2020/5-food-and-beverage-trends-in-europe-during-covid-19].
Therefore, these alternative treatments and prophylactics are also important to consider in the context of COVID-19, especially since their regulation is less rigorous than that of pharmaceuticals in many places.
Unlike pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals do not entirely fall under the responsibility of the FDA, but they are monitored as dietary supplements according to the Dietary Supplement, Health and Education Act 1994 (DSHEA) [@url:https://ods.od.nih.gov/About/DSHEA_Wording.aspx] and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act 1997 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/selected-amendments-fdc-act/food-and-drug-administration-modernization-act-fdama-1997].
Due to the increased sales of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals, the FDA established the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs (ODSP) in 1996 to increase surveillance.
However, there is significant concern that these acts do not adequately protect the consumer as they ascribe responsibility on the manufacturers to ensure safety of the product before manufacturing or marketing [@doi:10.1080/17512433.2018.1464911].
Likewise, manufacturers are not required to register or seek approval from the FDA to produce or sell food supplements or nutraceuticals.
Health or nutrient content claims for labeling purposes are approved based on an authoritative statement from the Academy of Sciences or relevant federal authorities once the FDA has been notified and on the basis that the information is known to be true and not deceptive [@doi:10.1080/17512433.2018.1464911].
In Europe, health claims are permitted on a product label only following compliance and authorization according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines on nutrition and health claims [@url:https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/claims/register/public].
EFSA does not currently distinguish between food supplements and nutraceuticals for health claim applications of new products, as claim authorization is dependent on the availability of clinical data in order to substantiate efficacy [@doi:10.1111/bcp.13496].
These guidelines seem to provide more protection to consumers.
Currently, there is a debate among scientists and regulatory authorities over developing a regulatory framework to deal with the challenges of safety and health claim substantiation for nutraceuticals [@doi:10.1111/bcp.13496; @doi:10.1080/17512433.2018.1464911].
As a result, studies of supplements and nutraceuticals do not necessarily follow the same rigorous clinical trial framework used for pharmaceuticals.

Nutraceuticals and supplements purported to "boost" the immune response, reduce immunopathology, exhibit antiviral activities, or prevent ARDS are being considered for their potential therapeutic value [@doi:10/ggkd3b].
A host of potential candidates have been highlighted in the literature that target various aspects of the COVID-19 viral pathology, while others are thought to prime the host immune system.
These candidates include vitamins and minerals along with extracts and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707].
_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies suggest that nutraceuticals containing phycocyanobilin, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, selenium or phase 2 inductive nutraceuticals (e.g. ferulic acid, lipoic acid, or sulforaphane) can prevent or modulate RNA virus infections via amplification of the signaling activity of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and activation of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007].
While promising, further animal and human studies are required to assess the therapeutic potential of these various nutraceuticals against COVID-19.

### n-3 PUFA

One supplement that has been explored for beneficial effects against various viral infections is n-3 PUFA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707], such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
EPA and DHA intake can come from a diet high in fish or through dietary supplementation with fish oils or purified oils [@doi:10.1039/c9fo01742a].
They can mediate inflammation and therefore may have the capacity to modulate the adaptive immune response [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04374.x; @doi:10.1039/c9fo01742a; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
Another potential mechanism that has led to interest in n-3 PUFA for viral infections is its potential as a precursor molecule for the biosynthesis of endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPM), such as protectins and resolvins, that actively resolve inflammation and infection [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.02.009].
Finally, some COVID-19 patients, particularly those with comorbidities, are at a significant risk of thrombotic complications including arterial and venous thrombosis [@doi:10.1182/blood.2020006000; @doi:10.1007/s11239-020-02134-3].
Therefore, the use of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulants and antithrombotic agents is under consideration [@doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.031], which could potentially include n-3 PUFA.

SPM have exhibited beneficial effects against a variety of lung infections, including some caused by RNA viruses [@doi:10.1038/nri.2015.4].
Indeed, protectin D1 has been shown to increase survival from H1N1 viral infection in mice by affecting the viral replication machinery [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.027].
Several mechanisms for SPM have been proposed, including preventing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines or increasing phagocytosis of cellular debris by macrophages [@doi:10.1038/nature13479].
In influenza, SPM promote antiviral B lymphocytic activities [@doi:10.4049/jimmunol.1302795], and protectin D1 has been shown to increase survival from H1N1 viral infection in mice by affecting the viral replication machinery [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.027].
It is hypothesized that SPM could aid in the resolution of the cytokine storm and pulmonary inflammation associated with COVID-19 [@doi:10.1007/s10555-020-09889-4].
However, not all studies are in agreement that n-3 PUFA is effective against infections [@doi:10.3945/jn.109.108027].
At a minimum, the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA against infections would be dependent on the dosage, timing, and the specific pathogens responsible [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2016.10.001].
On another level, there is still the question of whether fish oils can raise the levels of SPM levels upon ingestion and in response to acute inflammation in humans [@doi:10.1194/jlr.M060392].

The increased risk of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 infected patients was reported relatively late in comparison to other manifestations of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013; @doi:10.1182/blood.2020006000].
Considering that there is significant evidence that n-3 fatty acids and other fish oil-derived lipids possess antithrombotic properties and anti-inflammatory properties [@doi:10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2018.09.005; @doi:10.1016/j.blre.2020.100694], they may have therapeutic value against the prothrombotic complications of COVID-19.
Based on concern among the medical community that the use of investigational therapeutics on COVID-19 patients already on antiplatelet therapies due to a pre-existing comorbidities may lead to issues with dosing and drug choice, and/or negative drug-drug interactions [@doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.031], this supplementation holds particular interest for the treatment of patients already receiving pharmaceutical antiplatelet therapies.
As a result, the use of other therapeutics, such as dietary sources of n-3 fatty acids or nutraceuticals with antiplatelet activities, may be beneficial and warrant further investigation.
A new clinical trial [@clinicaltrials:NCT04412018] is currently recruiting COVID-19 positive patients to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of a recently developed, highly purified nutraceutical derivative of EPA known as icosapent ethyl (Vascepa^TM^) [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1812792].
Other randomized controlled trials are in the preparatory stages with the intention of investigating the administration of EPA and other bioactive compounds to COVID-19 positive patients to determine whether anti-inflammatory effects or disease state improvements are observed [@clinicaltrials:NCT04335032; @clinicaltrials:NCT04323228].
Finally, while there have been studies investigating the therapeutic value of n-3 fatty acids against ARDS in humans, there is still limited evidence of their effectiveness [@doi:10.3390/ijms21093104].
It should be noted that the overall lack of human studies in this area means there is limited evidence as to whether these supplements and nutraceuticals could affect COVID-19 infection.
Consequently, clinical trials have been proposed and many are in the preparatory stages.
These trials will investigate whether the anti-inflammatory potential of n-3 PUFA and their derivatives is beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
Therefore, the evidence is not present to draw conclusions about whether n-3 PUFA will be useful in treating COVID-19, but as there is likely little harm associated with a diet rich in fish oils, interest in these products by the general public is unlikely to have negative effects.

### Zinc

There is evidence that certain nutrient supplements may exhibit some benefit against RNA viral infections.
Zinc is a trace metal obtained from dietary sources or supplementation that is important for the maintenance of immune cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc supplements can be administered orally as a tablet or as a lozenge and they are available in many forms, such as zinc picolinate, zinc acetate, and zinc citrate.
Zinc is also available from dietary sources including meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, legumes, and dairy.
The role of zinc in immune function has been extensively reviewed [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc is an important signaling molecule and zinc levels can alter host defense systems.
In inflammatory situations such as an infection, zinc can regulate leukocyte immune responses and it can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), thus altering cytokine production [@doi:10.4049/jimmunol.179.6.4180; @doi:10.1067/mlc.2001.118108].
In particular, zinc supplementation can increase natural killer cell levels, which are important cells for host defense against viral infections [@doi:10.1126/science.1198687; @doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].

Adequate zinc intake has been associated with reduced incidence of infection [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837] and antiviral immunity [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmz013].
Similarly, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that administered zinc supplementation to elderly subjects over the course of a year found zinc deficiency to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection and that zinc deficiency could be prevented through supplementation [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837].
Clinical trial data supports the utility of zinc to diminish the duration and severity of symptoms associated with common colds when it is provided within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms [@doi:10.1331/1544-3191.44.5.594.Hulisz; @doi:10.2174/1874306401105010051].
In coronaviruses specifically, _in vitro_ evidence demonstrates that the combination of zinc (Zn2+) and zinc ionophores (pyrithione) can interrupt the replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-GFP (a fluorescently tagged SARS-CoV-1) and a variety of other RNA viruses [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.015].
Currently, there are over twenty clinical trials registered with the intention to use zinc in a preventative or therapeutic manner.
However, many of these trials proposed the use of zinc in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [@clinicaltrials:NCT04370782; @clinicaltrials:NCT04377646; @clinicaltrials:NCT04395768; @clinicaltrials:NCT04373733], and it is not known how the lack of evidence supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine will affect investigation of zinc.
Other trials, however, are investigating zinc in conjunction with other supplements such as vitamin C or n-3 PUFA [@clinicaltrials:NCT04342728; @clinicaltrials:NCT04323228].
Though there is, overall, encouraging data for zinc supplementation against the common cold and viral infections, there is currently limited evidence to suggest zinc supplementation has any beneficial effects against the current novel COVID-19; thus, the clinical trials that are currently underway will provide vital information on the efficacious use of zinc in COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment.
However, given the limited risk, maintaining a healthy diet to ensure an adequate zinc status may be advisable for individuals seeking to reduce their likelihood of infection.

### Vitamin C

Vitamins B, C, D, and E have also been suggested as potential nutrient supplement interventions for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707; @doi:10.20944/preprints202003.0347.v1].
In particular vitamin C has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent against COVID-19.
Vitamin C can be obtained via dietary sources such as fruit and vegetable or via supplementation.
Vitamin C plays a significant role in promoting immune function due to its effects on various immune cells.
It affects inflammation by modulating cytokine production, decreasing histamine levels, enhancing the differentiation and proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes, increasing antibody levels, and protecting against the negative effects of reactive oxygen species amongst other effects [@doi:10.1155/2014/426740; @doi:10.1007/s00210-013-0880-1; @doi:10.3390/nu9111211].
Vitamin C is utilized by the body during viral infections, as evinced by lower concentrations in leukocytes and lower concentrations of urinary vitamin C.
Post-infection, these levels return to baseline ranges [@doi:10.1177/003693307301800102; @doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1975.tb29312.x; @doi:10/fd22sv; @doi:10.3390/nu9040339; @doi:10.1079/bjn19920004].

A recent meta-analysis found consistent support for regular vitamin C supplementation reducing the duration of the common cold, but that supplementation with vitamin C (> 200 mg) failed to reduce the incidence of colds [@doi:10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4].
Individual studies have found Vitamin C to reduce the susceptibility of patients to lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia [@doi:10.1097/00006454-199709000-00003].
Another meta-analysis has demonstrated in twelve trials that vitamin C supplementation reduced the length of stay of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) by 7.8% (95% CI: 4.2% to 11.2%; p = 0.00003).
Furthermore, high doses (1-3 g/day) significantly reduced the length of an ICU stay by 8.6% in six trials (p = 0.003).
Vitamin C also shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation by 18.2% in three trials in which patients required intervention for over 24 hours (95% CI 7.7% to 27%; p = 0.001) [@doi:10.3390/nu11040708].
Despite these findings, the CITRUS ALI study failed to show a benefit of a 96-hour infusion of vitamin C to treat ARDS, which is a severe complication of COVID-19 infection [@doi:10.1001/jama.2019.11825].
Nevertheless, a randomized placebo-controlled trial [@clinicaltrials:NCT04264533] has begun in Wuhan, China to investigate the intravenous infusion of vitamin C to treat pneumonia in 140 severe COVID-19 infected patients.
As summarized by Carr [@doi:10.1186/s13054-020-02851-4] the trial will not be completed until September 2020.
Another trial in Italy [@clinicaltrials:NCT04323514] intends to deliver a 10 g infusion of vitamin C to 500 severe COVID-19 patients with pneumonia to assess in-hospital mortality over a 72 hr period as the primary outcome.
The trial is currently recruiting and is due to run until March 2021.
We will not know how effective vitamin C is as a therapeutic for quite some time due to the length of both trials.
These are not the only trials investigating the potential value of vitamin C, as there are currently (as of October 2020) over fifteen trials registered with clinicaltrials.gov that are either recruiting or are currently in preparation.
When completed, the trials will provide crucial evidence on the efficacy of vitamin C as a therapeutic for COVID-19 infection.
Thus, some evidence suggests that vitamin C supplementation or infusion can shorten the duration of a cold, reduce an individual's susceptibility to infections, and shorten a patient's stay in an ICU when administered at high doses, but we don't yet understand if these findings apply to COVID-19.
There are ongoing trials in China and Italy that will inform our understanding of the therapeutic value of vitamin C supplementation for COVID-19.
Once again, vitamin C intake is likely to be part of a healthy diet and the vitamin likely presents minimal risk, but its potential prophylactic or therapeutic effects against COVID-19 are unknown.

### Vitamin D

In terms of other dietary supplements, vitamin D can modulate the adaptive and innate immune system and has been associated with various aspects of health.
Vitamin D can be sourced through diet or supplementation, but it is mainly biosynthesized by the body on exposure to sunlight.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755].
In particular, vitamin D deficient patients are at risk of developing acute respiratory infections [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017] and ARDS [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017].
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the more active form of vitamin D that is involved in adaptive and innate responses, however, due to a short half life of a few hours, it is measured by its longer lasting precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The vitamin D receptor is expressed in various immune cells and vitamin D is an immunomodulator of antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and T- and B-lymphocytes [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755; @doi:10.1016/j.coph.2010.04.001].
Due to its potential immunomodulating properties, vitamin D supplementation may be advantageous to maintain a healthy immune system.

One influential review postulated that an individual’s vitamin D status may significantly affect their risk of developing COVID-19 [@doi:10.3390/nu12040988].
This hypothesis was derived from the fact that the current pandemic emerged in winter in Wuhan China when 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are at their lowest due to a lack of sunlight, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, where it was nearing the end of the summer and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations would be higher, the number of cases was low.
The authors suggested that people at risk of developing COVID-19 should increase their vitamin D3 intake to reach 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma concentrations above 40–60 ng/ml.
The authors also suggest high-dose supplementation of vitamin D to treat infected patients and to prevent infection in hospital staff [@doi:10.3390/nu12040988].
While vitamin D is relatively inexpensive and safe to consume, caution is warranted when interpreting this review as it has yet to be determined whether vitamin D levels affect COVID-19 outside of this geographic/climatic correlation.
Likewise, though it is assumed that COVID-19 may be seasonal, multiple other factors that can affect vitamin D levels should also be considered.
These factors include an individual’s nutritional status, their age, their occupation, skin pigmentation, potential comorbidities, and the variation of exposure to sunlight due to latitude amongst others.
As the pandemic evolves, further research has investigated some of the potential links identified in the Grant et al. review [@doi:10.3390/nu12040988] between vitamin D and COVID-19 and sought to shed light on whether there is any prophylactic and/or therapeutic relationship.
A study in Switzerland demonstrated that 27 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibited 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma concentrations that were significantly lower (11.1 ng/ml) than those of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (24.6 ng/ml; p = 0.004), an association that held when stratifying for patients greater than 70 years old [@doi:10.3390/nu12051359].
These findings seem to be supported by a Belgian observational study of 186 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibiting symptoms of pneumonia, where 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma concentrations were measured and a CT scan of the lungs was obtained upon hospitalization [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.01.20079376].
A significant difference in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was observed between the SARS-CoV-2 patients and 2,717 season-matched diseased controls.
Both female and male patients possessed lower median 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations than the control group (18.6 ng/ml versus 21.5 ng/ml; p = 0.0016) and a higher rate of vitamin D deficiency (58.6% versus 42.5%).
Evidence of sexual dimorphism was apparent, as female patients had equivalent levels of 23-hydroxyvitamin D to the control group, whereas male patients were deficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D relative to male controls (67% versus 49%; p = 0.0006).
Notably, vitamin D deficiency was progressively lower in males with advancing radiological disease stages (p = 0.001).
These studies are supported by several others that indicate that vitamin D status may be an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0239799; @doi:10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.021; @doi:10.1111/febs.15495; @doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19722] and in COVID-19 patients relative to population-based controls [@doi:10.1210/clinem/dgaa733].
Indeed, serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/ml, which indicate vitamin D sufficiency, seems to be associated with a reduction in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, along with increased lymphocyte levels, which suggests that vitamin D levels may modulate the immune response by reducing risk for cytokine storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Despite these studies potentially linking vitamin D status with COVID-19 severity, an examination of the UK Biobank did not support this thesis [@doi:10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.050].
This analysis examined 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in 348,598 UK Biobank participants, of which 449 were SARS-CoV-2 positive.
However, this study has caused considerable debate that will likely be settled following further studies [@doi:10.1111/cen.14276; @doi:10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.046].
There is significant interest in the link between vitamin D and COVID-19, hence the multitude of studies published in the literature of varying quality and the clinical trials underway.
One trial is currently investigating the utility of vitamin D as an immune-modulating agent by monitoring whether administration of vitamin D precipitates an improvement of health status in non-severe symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 or whether vitamin D prevents patient deterioration [@clinicaltrials:NCT04334005].
Other trials are also underway examining various factors including mortality, symptom recovery, severity of disease, rates of ventilation, inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6, blood cell counts, and the prophylactic capacity of vitamin D administration [@clinicaltrials:NCT04385940; @clinicaltrials:NCT04334005; @clinicaltrials:NCT04411446; @clinicaltrials:NCT04344041].
Concomitant administration of vitamin D with pharmaceuticals such as aspirin [@clinicaltrials:NCT04363840] and bioactive molecules such as resveratrol [@clinicaltrials:NCT04400890] are also under investigation.

While there is increasing evidence that vitamin D status is linked to COVID-19 outcomes, the effectiveness of its supplementation remains open for debate.
Once again, supplementation of vitamin D and maintaining a healthy diet for optimum vitamin D status is unlikely to carry major health risks while the possible link between vitamin D status and COVID-19 is investigated.
However, pursuing to elevate vitamin D levels through sunlight exposure does carry additional risks, as many densely populated cities and countries around the world are sporadically utilizing "shelter in place" orders to enforce social distancing guidelines, especially with cases rising again as winter 2020 approaches.
Given the lack of conclusive evidence in support of vitamin D supplementation, it is not clear that these guidelines present additional risk.
However, to the extent that people are able to maintain safe exposure to sunlight, there is a possibility that it could improve endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, potentially strengthening the immune system.

### Probiotics

Probiotics are “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” [@doi:10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66].
Some studies suggest that probiotics are beneficial against common viral infections and there is modest evidence to suggest that they can modulate the immune response [@doi:10.4082/kjfm.2013.34.1.2; @doi:10.2174/1381612824666180116163411], and as a result it has been hypothesized that probiotics may have therapeutic value worthy of investigation against SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.3389/fpubh.2020.00186].
Probiotics and next-generation probiotics, which are more akin to pharmacological-grade supplements, have been associated with multiple potential beneficial effects for allergies, digestive tract disorders, and even metabolic diseases through their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [@doi:10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.57; @doi:10.1093/advances/nmy063].
However, the mechanisms by which probiotics affect these various conditions would likely differ among strains, with the ultimate effect of the probiotic depending on the heterogeneous set of bacteria present [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmy063].
Some of the beneficial effects of probiotics include reducing inflammation by promoting the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, inhibiting toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, direct competition with pathogens, the synthesis of antimicrobial substances or other metabolites, improving intestinal barrier function, and/or favorably altering the gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis [@doi:10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2019.05.010; @doi:10.1093/advances/nmy063; @doi:10.1159/000342079].
However, there is also a bi-directional relationship between the lungs and gut microbiota known as the gut-lung axis [@doi:10.1038/mi.2011.55], whereby gut microbial metabolites and endotoxins may affect the lungs via the circulatory system and the lung microbiota in return may affect the gut [@doi:10.1111/cmi.12966].
Therefore, the gut-lung axis may play role in our future understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and become a target for probiotic treatments [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198018].

Probiotics have tentatively been associated with the reduction of risk and duration of viral upper respiratory tract infections [@doi:10.1007/s10096-014-2086-y; @doi:10.1002/14651858.CD006895.pub3; @doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.11.005].
Some meta-analyses that have assessed the efficacy of probiotics in viral respiratory infections have reported moderate reductions in the incidence and duration of infection [@doi:10.1002/14651858.CD006895.pub3; @doi:10.1017/S0007114514000075].
Indeed, randomized controlled trials have shown that administering _Bacillus subtilis_ and _Enterococcus faecalis_ [@doi:10.1007/s00134-016-4303-x], _Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG_ [@doi:10.1164/rccm.200912-1853OC], or _Lactobacillus casei_ and _Bifidobacterium breve_ with galactooligosaccharides [@doi:10.1186/s13054-018-2167-x] via the nasogastric tube to ventilated patients reduced the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in comparison to the respective control groups in studies of viral infections and sepsis.
These findings are supported by a recently published meta-analysis [@doi:10.4187/respcare.07097].
There is a significant risk of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.12340496], but it can be challenging for clinicians to diagnose this infection due to the fact that severe COVID-19 infection presents with the symptoms of pneumonia [@doi:10.1186/s13054-020-03013-2].
Therefore, an effective prophylactic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in severe COVID-19 patients would be of significant therapeutic value.

Probiotics are generally synonymous with the treatment of gastrointestinal issues due to their supposed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [@doi:10/d2qp].
Notably, gastrointestinal symptoms commonly occur in COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.020], and the ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in enterocytes of the ileum and colon, suggesting that these organs may be a potential route of infection [@doi:10.1101/2020.01.30.927806; @doi:10.1038/cr.2016.152].
Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in human feces [@doi:10/ggq8zp], and fecal-oral transmission of the virus has not yet been ruled out [@doi:10/ggpx7s].
Rectal swabs of some SARS-CoV-2 positive pediatric patients persistently tested positive for several days despite negative nasopharyngeal tests, indicating the potential for fecal viral shedding [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0817-4].
However, there is conflicting evidence for the therapeutic value of various probiotics against the incidence or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in viral or bacterial infections such as gastroenteritis [@doi:10.1007/s00203-017-1400-3; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1802597].
Nevertheless, it has been proposed that the administration of probiotics to COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers may prevent or ameliorate the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19, a hypothesis that several clinical trials are now preparing to investigate [@clinicaltrials:NCT04420676; @clinicaltrials:NCT04366180].
Other studies are investigating whether probiotics may affect patient outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection [@clinicaltrials:NCT04390477].

Generally, the efficacy of probiotic use is a controversial topic among scientists.
In Europe, EFSA has banned the term probiotics on products labels, which has elicited either criticism for EFSA or support for probiotics from researchers in the field [@doi:10.1016/j.bpg.2015.12.001; @doi:10.1017/S000711451100287X; @doi:10.1038/nrgastro.2014.66].
This is due to the hyperbolic claims placed on the labels of various probiotic products, which lack rigorous scientific data to support their efficacy.
Overall, the data supporting probiotics in the treatment or prevention of many different disorders and diseases is not conclusive as the quality of the evidence is generally considered low [@doi:10.1007/s10096-014-2086-y].
However, in the case of probiotics and respiratory infections, the evidence seems to be supportive of their potential therapeutic value.
Consequently, several investigations are underway to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of probiotics for COVID-19.
However, blind use of conventional probiotics for COVID-19 is cautioned against until the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is further established [@doi:10/d2qq].
Until clinical trials investigating the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of probiotics for COVID-19 are complete, it is not possible to provide an evidence-based recommendation for their use.

### Misinformation

### Conclusions

Despite all the potential benefits of nutraceutical and dietary supplement interventions presented, currently there is a paucity of clinical evidence to support their use for the prevention or mitigation of COVID-19 infections.
Nevertheless, optimal nutritional status can prime an individual’s immune system to protect against the effects of acute respiratory viral infections by supporting normal maintenance of the immune system [@doi:10.3390/nu12041181; @doi:10.3390/nu12051466].
Nutritional strategies can also play a role in the treatment of hospitalized patients, as malnutrition is a risk to COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1038/s41430-020-0664-x].
Overall, supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may be an effective method of ensuring their adequate intake to maintain optimal immune function, which may also convey beneficial effects against viral infections due to their immunomodulatory effects.
However, many supplements and nutraceuticals designed for various ailments are available in the United States and beyond that are not strictly regulated [@doi:10.1080/10408398.2019.1592107].
Indeed, there can be safety and efficacy concerns associated with many of these products.
Often, the vulnerable members of society can be exploited in this regard and unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic is no different.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings to several companies for advertising falsified claims in relation to the preventative and therapeutic capabilities of their products against COVID-19 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-update-fda-and-ftc-warn-seven-companies-selling-fraudulent-products-claim-treat-or].
In light of these serious occurrences, it is pertinent to clarify that the nutraceuticals discussed in this review have been selected because of their possible relevance to the biological mechanisms that can beneficially affect viral and respiratory infections and because they are currently under clinical investigation.
Therefore, further intensive investigation is required to establish the effects of these nutraceuticals, if any, against COVID-19.
Until effective therapeutics are established, the most effective mitigation strategies consist of encouraging standard public health practices such as regular hand washing with soap, wearing a face mask, and covering a cough with your elbow [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html], along with following social distancing measures, "shelter in place" guidelines, expansive testing, and contact tracing [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.27.20045815; @doi:10.3201/eid2608.201093].

Many researchers have also focused their attention to the potential use of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals.
Indeed, there has been recent interest for the potential use of vitamin D as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against COVID-19 as several observational studies have linked low vitamin D status to its incidence [@doi:10.1111/joim.13149; @doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19722].
These associations have yet to be confirmed and rigorous trials are required before considering supplementation recommendations.
However, the nutritional status and general health of a patient can affect their outcomes in various diseases, thus it would be pertinent to advise people to follow a healthy diet and life style to the best of their ability to prevent nutrient deficiencies and insufficiencies and to maintain a healthy immune system [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmaa125].
