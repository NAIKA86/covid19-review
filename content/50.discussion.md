## Discussion

<!-- This section is a stub. Additional work is needed to flesh this section out. Outlining or writing help is welcome!-->
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, the scientific community has responded by rapidly collecting and disseminating information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its ability to infect humans and other animals.
This fundamental information has allowed for innovations in the areas of diagnostics and therapeutics that continue to be proposed and developed upon.
In this review, we seek to explain the scientific rationale underlying these technologies and to critically evaluate the literature available about them.

### Current State of Diagnostics

### Current State of Therapeutics

The majority of current clinical trials and lines of investigation have focused on repurposing existing therapies to counter SARS-CoV-2 and treat its symptoms.
This approach is necessary given the urgency of the situation as well as the extensive time required for developing and testing new therapies.
However, in the long-term, new drugs specific for treatment of COVID-19 may also enter development.
There is thus value in investigating two lines of inquiry for treatment of COVID-19: 1) new therapeutics specific for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms, and 2) repurposing of existing therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms.
Here we consider further avenues that scientific investigators may explore in the development of therapies for COVID-19.

While studies of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have not supported the early theoretical interest in this antiviral treatment, it may be of interest to explore alternatives with similar mechanisms.
For example, hydroxyferroquine derivatives of HCQ have been described as a class of bioorganometallic compounds that exert antiviral effects with some selectivity for SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1021/jm0601856].
Future work could explore whether these compounds exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and whether they are safe for use in animals and humans.

The tocilizumab trial described in an above section [@doi:10/ggnxb3] studies the possibility of using an anti-inflammatory agent typically used for the treatment of autoimmune disease to counter the effects of the “cytokine storm” induced by the virus.
Another anti-IL-6 antibody, sarilumab, is also being investigated [@url:http://www.news.sanofi.us/2020-03-16-Sanofi-and-Regeneron-begin-global-Kevzara-R-sarilumab-clinical-trial-program-in-patients-with-severe-COVID-19; @clinicaltrials:NCT04327388].
Typically, immunosuppressive drugs such as these are contraindicated in the setting of infection [@doi:10.1177/2040622313485275].
However, COVID-19 results in hyperinflammation that appears to contribute to mortality via lung damage, suggesting that immunosuppression may be a helpful approach to treatment [@doi:10/ggnzmc].
The decision of whether and/or when to counter hyperinflammation with immunosuppression in the setting of COVID-19 remains in debate as the risks of inhibiting antiviral immunity continue to be weighed against the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10/ggq8hs].
If the need to curtail the “cytokine storm” inflammatory response to the virus transcends the risks of immunosuppression, exploration of more anti-inflammatory agents may be warranted; these agents are considered here.
While tocilizumab targets IL-6, several other inflammatory markers could be potential targets, including TNF-alpha. Inhibition of TNF-alpha by an inhibitor such as Etanercept has been previously suggested for treatment of SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1185/030079903125002757] and may be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 as well.
Baricitinib and other small molecule inhibitors of the JAK kinase pathway also curtail the inflammatory response and have been suggested as potential options for SARS-CoV-2 infections [@doi:10/dph5].
Baricitinib in particular may be able to reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect lung cells [@doi:10/ggnrsx].
Clinical trials studying baricitinib in COVID-19 have already begun in the US and in Italy [@url:https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-begins-clinical-testing-therapies-covid-19; @clinicaltrials:NCT04320277].
Identification and targeting of further inflammatory markers that are relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be of value for curtailing the inflammatory response and lung damage.
Lastly, it is also worth noting the high costs of tocilizumab therapy and other biologics: at doses used for rheumatoid arthritis patients, the cost for tocilizumab ranges from $179.20 to $896 per dose for the IV form and $355 for the pre-filled syringe [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349513/table/T43/].
Cyclosporine may be a more cost-effective and readily-available alternative than biologics [@url:https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/meyers_pp/385], if it proves effective against the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2.

Another approach is the development of antivirals, which could be broad-spectrum, specific to coronaviruses, or targeted to SARS-CoV-2.
Given the increasingly apparent role of the cytokine storm in disease pathogenesis, it is possible that antivirals could be less effective in more severe cases of COVID-19, but this is not yet known; regardless, it is likely that early-stage patients could benefit from antiviral therapy.
The potential for remdesivir as an antiviral has already been described in an above section.
Development of new antivirals is complicated by the fact that none have yet been approved for human coronaviruses.
Intriguing new options are emerging, however.
Beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an orally bioavailable ribonucleotide analog showing broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses, which may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883].
Various other antivirals are in development.
Development of antivirals will be further facilitated as research reveals more information about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cell and host cell genome, mechanisms of viral replication, mechanisms of viral assembly, and mechanisms of viral release to other cells; this can allow researchers to target specific stages and structures of the viral life cycle.

Antibodies against viruses, also known as antiviral monoclonal antibodies, could be an alternative as well and are described in detail in an above section.
The goal of antiviral antibodies is to neutralize viruses through either cell-killing activity or blocking of viral replication [@doi:10.1016/j.tim.2015.07.005].
They may also engage the host immune response, encouraging the immune system to hone in on the virus.
Given the cytokine storm that results from immune system activation in response to the virus, which has been implicated in worsening of the disease, a neutralizing antibody (nAb) may be preferable.
Upcoming work may explore the specificity of nAbs for their target, mechanisms by which the nAbs impede the virus, and improvements to antibody structure that may enhance the ability of the antibody to block viral activity.

There is also some research into possible potential therapeutics or prophylactics which interact with components of the innate immune response.
For example, there are a variety of toll-like receptors (TLRs) which are examples of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), innate immune response components which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).
Note that TLRs form a part of innate immune recognition and can more generally contribute to promoting both innate and adaptive responses [@ISBN:9780815332183].
In mouse models, poly(I:C) and CpG, which are agonists of toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR9, respectively, showed protective effects when administered prior to SARS-CoV infection [@doi:10.1128/JVI.01410-12].
Therefore, TLR agonists hold some potential for broad-spectrum prophylaxis.
Another type of approach which is being investigated is the possible use of what is termed trained immunity, in particular as elicited by non-SARS-CoV-2 whole-microorganism vaccines (or other microbial stimuli), as a tool which might be shown to generate heterologous protective effects with respect to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or severity [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042].
In a recent review [@doi:10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6], trained immunity was defined as forms of memory which are temporary (e.g., months or years, and reversible), displayed by innate immune cells and innate immune features of other cells, displayed as increased responsiveness to future same or heterologous pathogen infection or sometimes decreased responsiveness or immunological tolerance, and established through epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms.
One type of stimulus which research indicates can induce trained immunity is bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination.
BCG is an attenuated form of bacteria _Mycobacterium bovis_.
The vaccine is most commonly administered for the prevention of tuberculosis in humans.
With respect to SARS-CoV-2 specifically, clinical trials in non-SARS-CoV-2-infected adults have been setup to assess the possible efficacy of BCG vaccination -- e.g., to assess if it may be effective as a potential prophylactic or potential partial prophylactic in (1) reducing susceptibility / preventing infection and (2) reducing disease severity (for descriptions of trials with BCG vaccine or the related vaccine VPM1002, see [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042; @clinicaltrials:NCT04327206; @clinicaltrials:NCT04328441; @clinicaltrials:NCT04348370; @clinicaltrials:NCT04350931; @clinicaltrials:NCT04362124; @clinicaltrials:NCT04369794; @clinicaltrials:NCT04373291; @clinicaltrials:NCT04379336; @clinicaltrials:NCT04384549; @clinicaltrials:NCT04387409; @clinicaltrials:NCT04414267; @clinicaltrials:NCT04417335; @clinicaltrials:NCT04435379; @clinicaltrials:NCT04439045]).
Some trials enroll healthcare workers, other trials hospitalized elderly adults without immunosuppression who get vaccinated with placebo or BCG at hospital discharge, and yet another set of trials older adults (>50 years) under chronic care for conditions like hypertension and diabetes.
One set of trials, for example, uses time until first infection as the primary study endpoint; more generally, outcomes measured in some of these trials are related to incidence of disease and disease severity or symptoms.
An article [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042] that very briefly summarizes the setup of these trials also mentions some data analyses which showed possible correlations between countries which have more BCG vaccination (or BCG vaccination policies) and the severity of COVID-19 in those countries, but (1) it is unclear whether this correlation indicates an interaction because for example of many other possible factors or confounding factors (country age distribution, detection efficiency, stochastic epidemic dynamic effects, differences in healthcare capacity over time in relation to epidemic dynamics, and various other factors) and (2) also it is unclear what is the relation between BCG vaccination at different ages and at longer times before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and BCG vaccination at different ages during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic at shorter times before the risk of possible infection; at least some of these considerations are also made or pointed out in the data analyses sited and in the article.
The article [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042] also includes various related considerations such as efficacy in related animal and human studies and the safety of the vaccine, both generally and specifically with respect to SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, we review here one of the most important considerations: severe SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized so far to possibly exhibit dysregulated immune responses and whether or when some immune responses are protective or pathogenic is still under research (e.g., [@doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009; @doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.009; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042; @doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.008]); also, trained immunity itself may sometimes be related to either balanced, or too much or too little, or useful or harmful immunological responses.
The article [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042] proposes that trained immunity might lead to an earlier stronger response which could reduce viremia and avoid (possibly with the additional support of another therapeutic administered later) the later detrimental immunopathology seen with severe cases; while this is a possibility, additional research is required to assess its validity.

In the longer term, as more information becomes available about the structures of SARS-CoV-2 components, small molecule inhibitors of those components may become candidates for drug discovery.
For example, crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease have recently been resolved [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; @url:https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html].
Efforts have already been in place to perform screens for small molecule inhibitors of the main protease, yielding potential hits [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882].
Much work remains to be done to determine further crystal structures of other viral components, understand the relative utility of targeting different viral components, perform additional small molecule inhibitor screens, and determine the safety and efficacy of the potential inhibitors.
While still nascent, work in this area is promising.

### Social Factors Influencing COVID-19 Outcomes

The evidence clearly indicates that social environmental factors are critical determinants of individuals' and communities' risks related to COVID-19.
There are distinct components to COVID-19 susceptibility, and an individual's risk can be elevated at one or all stages from exposure to recovery/mortality: an individual may be more likely to be exposed to the virus, more likely to get infected once exposed, more likely to have serious complications once infected, be less likely to receive adequate care once they are seriously ill.
The fact that differences in survival between Black and white patients were no longer significant after controlling for comorbidities and socioeconomic status (type of insurance, neighborhood deprivation score, and hospital where treatment was received) in addition to sex and age [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039] underscores the relevance of social factors to understanding mortality differences between racial and ethnic groups.
Moreover, the Black patients were younger and more likely to be female than white patients, yet still had a higher mortality rate without correction for the other variables [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039].
Here, we outline a few systemic reasons that may exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic in communities of color.

#### Exposure to COVID-19

Social distancing has emerged as one of the main social policies used to manage the COVID-19 epidemic in many countries.
Many governments issued stay-at-home orders, especially in the initial months of the crisis.
However, data clearly indicates that these orders impacted different socioeconomic groups differently.
In U.S. counties with and without stay-at-home orders, smartphone tracking indicated a significant decrease in the general population's mobility in April relative to February through March of 2020 (-52.3% and -60.8%, respectively) [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
A linear relationship was observed between counties' reduction in mobility and their wealth and health, as measured by access to health care, food security, income, space, and other factors [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
Counties with greater reductions in mobility were also found to have much lower child poverty and household crowding and to be more racially segregated, and to have fewer youth and more elderly residents [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
Similar associations between wealth and decreased mobility were observed in cellphone GPS data from Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico collected between January and May 2020 [@arXiv:2006.15195].
These disparities in mobility are likely to be related to the role that essential workers have played during the pandemic.
Essential workers are disproportionately likely to be female, people of color, immigrants, and to have an income below 200% of the poverty line [@url:https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf].
Black Americans in particular are over-represented among front-line workers and in professions where social distancing is infeasible [@doi:10.1002/ajim.23145].
Health care work in particular presents an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1002/ajim.23145; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0232452; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichoccupationshavethehighestpotentialexposuretothecoronaviruscovid19/2020-05-11; @url:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892085/disparities_review.pdf].
In the United Kingdom, (South) Asians are more likely than their white counterparts to be medical professionals [@url:https://www.ifs.org.uk/inequality/chapter/are-some-ethnic-groups-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19-than-others/], although BAME medical professionals are still disproportionately represented in the proportion of National Health Service staff deaths [@url:https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article].
Similar trends have been reported for nurses, especially nurses of color, in the United States [@url:https://act.nationalnursesunited.org/page/-/files/graphics/0920_Covid19_SinsOfOmission_Data_Report.pdf].
Furthermore, beyond the risks associated with work itself, use of public transportation may also impact COVID-19 risk [@url:http://www.nber.org/papers/w27407].
The socioeconomic and racial/ethnic gaps in who is working on the front lines of the pandemic make it clear that socioeconomic privilege is likely to decrease the probability of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Increased risk of exposure can also arise outside the workplace.
Nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities received attention early on as high-risk locations for COVID-19 outbreaks [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.11642].
Prisons and detention centers also confer a high risk of exposure or infection [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.1856; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12528].
Populations in care facilities are largely older adults, and in the United States, incarcerated people are more likely to be male and persons of color, especially Black [@url:https://www.issuelab.org/resources/695/695.pdf].
Additionally, multi-generational households are less common among non-Hispanic white Americans than people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds [@doi:10.1111/j.1751-9020.2010.00306.x], increasing the risk of exposure for more susceptible family members.
Analysis suggests that household crowding may also be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 exposure [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624], and household crowding is associated with poverty [@doi:10.1037/12057-014].
Forms of economic insecurity like housing insecurity, which is associated with poverty and more pronounced in communities subjected to racism [@doi:10.7916/D8WH2W9T; @doi:10.1093/socpro/spv025], would be likely to increase household crowding and other possible sources of exposure.
As a result, facets of systemic inequality such as mass incarceration of Black Americans and poverty are likely to increase the risk of exposure outside of the workplace.

#### Severity of COVID-19 Following Exposure

Following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the likelihood that an individual develops COVID-19 and the severity of the disease presentation can be influenced by a number of social factors.
As discussed above, a number of patient characteristics are associated with the likelihood of severe COVID-19 symptoms.
In some cases, these trends run counter to those expected given rates of exposure: for example, although women are more likely to be exposed, men are more likely to be diagnosed with, hospitalized from, or die from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
In the case of comorbid conditions and racial/ethnic demographics, however, social factors are highly likely to modulate or at least influence the apparent association between these traits and the increased risk from COVID-19.
In particular, the comorbidities and racial/ethnic correlates of severe COVID-19 outcomes suggest that poverty confers additional risk for COVID-19.

In order to explore the relationship between poverty and COVID-19 outcomes, it is necessary to consider how poverty impacts biology.
In particular, we focus on the United States and the United Kingdom.
Comorbidities that increase risk for COVID-19, including obesity, type II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, are known to be intercorrelated [@doi:10/bpp37d].
Metabolic conditions related to heightened inflammation, like obesity, type II diabetes, and hypertension, are more strongly associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes than other comorbid conditions, such as chronic heart disease [@doi:10.2337/dbi19-0023].
As discussed above, dysregulated inflammation characteristic of cytokine release syndrome is one of the greatest concerns for COVID-19-related death.
Therefore, it is possible that chronic inflammation characteristic of these metabolic conditions predisposes patients to COVID-19-related death [@doi:10.2337/dbi19-0023].
The association between these diseases and severe COVID-19 outcomes is a concern from a health equity perspective because poverty exposes people to "obesogenic" conditions [@doi:10/gddg84] and is therefore unsurprisingly associated with higher incidence of obesity and associated disorders [@doi:10.5604/12321966.1120608].
Furthermore, cell phone GPS data suggests that lower socioeconomic status may also be associated with decreased access to healthy food choices during the COVID-19 pandemic [@doi:10.1002/oby.22940; @doi:10.1002/oby.22993], suggesting that health-related risk factors for COVID-19 may be exacerbated as the pandemic continues [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.07.002].
Chronic inflammation is a known outcome of chronic stress (e.g., [@doi:10.1067/mai.2000.110163; @doi:10.1037//0278-6133.21.6.531; @doi:10.1037/a0025536; @doi:10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00450.x]).
Therefore, the chronic stress of poverty is likely to influence health broadly (as summarized in @doi:10.2307/26061262) and especially during the stress of the ongoing pandemic.

A preprint [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502] provided observational evidence that geographical areas in the United States that suffer from worse air pollution by fine particulate matter have also suffered more COVID-19 deaths per capita, after adjusting for demographic covariates.
Although lack of individual-level exposure data and the impossibility of randomization make it difficult to elucidate the exact causal mechanism, this finding would be consistent with similar findings for all-cause mortality (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1803222115]).
Exposure to air pollution is associated with both poverty (e.g., [@doi:10.3390/ijerph15061114]) and chronic inflammation [@doi:10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.06.002].
Taken together, the evidence suggests that low-income workers who face greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to their home or work conditions are also more likely to face environmental and social stressors associated with increased inflammation, and therefore with increased risk from COVID-19.
In particular, structural racism can play an important role on disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, due to consequences of racism which include an increased likelihood of poverty and its associated food and housing instability.
COVID-19 can thus be considered a "syndemic", or a synergistic interaction between several epidemics [@doi:10.1002/ajhb.23482].
As a result, it is not surprising that people from minoritized backgrounds and/or with certain pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer severe effects of COVID-19, but these "risk factors" are likely to be causally linked to poverty.

#### Access to Treatment

Finally, COVID-19 outcomes can be influenced by access to healthcare.
Receiving care for COVID-19 can, but does not always, include receiving a positive test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
For example, it is common to see treatment guidelines for suspected cases regardless of whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed (e.g., [@doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036]).
Whether and where a patient is diagnosed can depend on their access to testing, which can vary both between and within countries.
In the United States, it is not always clear whether an individual will have access to free testing [@url:https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/19/880543755/insurers-may-only-pay-for-coronavirus-tests-when-theyre-medically-necessary; @url:https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2020/private-health-insurance-coverage-covid-19-public-health-emergency].
The concern has been raised that more economic privilege is likely to correspond to increased access to testing, at least within the United States [@doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046].
This is supported by the fact that African Americans seem to be more likely to be diagnosed in the hospital, while individuals from other groups were more likely to have been diagnosed in ambulatory settings in the community [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598].
Any delays in treatment are a cause for concern [@doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046], which could potentially be increased by an inability to acquire testing because in the United States, insurance coverage for care received can depend on a positive test [@url:https://www.hrsa.gov/coviduninsuredclaim/frequently-asked-questions].

Another important question is whether patients with moderate to severe cases are able to access hospital facilities and treatments, to the extent that they have been identified.
Early findings from China as of February 2020 suggested the COVID-19 mortality rate to be much lower in the most developed regions of the country [@doi:10/ggqscd], although reported mortality is generally an estimate of CFR, which is dependent on rates of testing.
Efforts to make treatment accessible for all confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in China are credited with expanding care to people with fewer economic resources [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0823-6].
In the United States, access to healthcare varies widely, with certain sectors of the workforce less likely to have health insurance; many essential workers in transportation, food service, and other frontline fields are among those likely to be uninsured or underinsured [@doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046].
As of 2018, Hispanic Americans of all races were much less likely to have health insurance than people from non-Hispanic backgrounds [@url:https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.pdf].
Therefore, access to diagnostics and care prior to the development of severe COVID-19 is likely to vary depending on socioeconomic and social factors, many of which overlap with the risks of exposure and of developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms.
This discrepancy ties into concerns about broad infrastructural challenges imposed by COVID-19.
A major concern in many countries has been the saturation of healthcare systems due to the volume of COVID-19 hospitalizations (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2004064117]).
Similarly, there have been shortages of supplies such as ventilators that are critical to the survival of many COVID-19 patients, leading to extensive ethical discussions about how to allocate limited resources among patients [@doi:10.19044/esj.2020.v16n21p24; @doi:10.7249/PEA228-1; @arxiv:2008.00374; @doi:10.1016/j.surg.2020.04.044].
Although it is generally considered unethical to consider demographic factors such as age, sex, race, or ethnicity while making such decisions, and ideally this information would not be shared with triage teams tasked with allocating limited resources among patients [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764137], there are substantial concerns about implicit and explicit biases against older adults [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16539], premature infants [@doi:10.1111/apa.15334], and people with disabilities or comorbidities [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764138; @doi:10.2105/AJPH.2020.305837; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764137].
Because of the greater burden of chronic disease in populations subjected to systemic racism, algorithms intended to be blind to race and ethnicity could, in fact, reinforce systemic inequalities caused by structural racism [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1777347; @doi:10.1016/j.jnma.2020.05.010; @doi: 10.1056/NEJMp2023616].
Because of this inequality, it has been argued that groups facing health disparities should be prioritized by these algorithms [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
This approach would carry its own ethical concerns, including the fact that many resources that need to be distributed do not have well-established risks and benefits [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].

As the pandemic has progressed, it has become clear that ICU beds and ventilators are not the only limited resources that needs to be allocated, and, in fact, the survival rate for patients who receive mechanical ventilation is lower than these discussions would suggest [@doi:10.1136/medethics-2020-106460].
Allocation of interventions that may reduce suffering, including palliative care, has become critically important [@doi:10.1136/medethics-2020-106460; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1788663].
The ambiguities surrounding the risks and benefits associated with therapeutics that have been approved under emergency use authorizations also present ethical concerns related to the distribution of resources [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
For example, remdesivir, discussed below, is an antiviral produced by Gilead that has shown some promise for alleviating symptoms and reducing the duration of hospitalization.
Remdesivir is currently available for the treatment of COVID-19 under compassionate use guidelines and through expanded access programs, and in many cases has been donated to hospitals by Gilead [@doi:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.06.016; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795529].
Regulations guiding the distribution of drugs in situations like these typically do not address how to determine which patients receive them [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795529].
Prioritizing marginalized groups for treatment with a drug like remdesivir would also be unethical because it would entail disproportionately exposing these groups to a therapeutic that may or not be beneficial [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
On the other hand, given that the drug is one of the most promising treatments available for many patients, using a framework that tacitly feeds into structural biases would also be unethical.
At present, the report prepared for the Director of the CDC by Ethics Subcommittee of the CDC fails to address the complexity of this ethical question given the state of structural racism in the United States, instead stating that "prioritizing individuals according to their chances for short-term survival also avoids ethically irrelevant considerations, such as race or socioeconomic status" [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/about/advisory/pdf/VentDocument_Release.pdf].
In many cases, experimental therapeutics are made available only through participation in clinical trials [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795541].
However, given the history of medical trials abusing minority communities, especially Black Americans, there is a history of unequal representation in clinical trial enrollment [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795541].
As a result, the standard practice of requiring enrollment in a clinical trial in order to receive experimental treatment may also reinforce patterns established by systemic racism.
<!--Risk of comorbid health conditions associated with more severe outcomes may be influenced by long-term damage caused by chronic stress related to traumatic social experiences [@doi:10.1007/s12170-013-0338-5], perhaps mediated by cardiovascular risk factors [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.10.20097253], although the effects of chronic stress have not yet been researched in the specific case of COVID-19 disparities.-->

#### Access to and Representation in Clinical Trials

Scientific and medical research is broadly shaped by a number of biases.
Bias in medicine can be characterized as when a physician and/or patient “others” an individual in a healthcare setting.
Some concerns of medical bias are how clinical trials recruit participants and operate.
The objective is to synthesize literature on how these clinical trial biases affect Covid-19 outcomes. 
 
While researchers aim to quickly yet effectively develop a vaccine for Covid-19 [maybe mention some of the research mentioned in the paper], there needs to be global representation in clinical trials to ensure equality.
The benefits and burdens of clinical trials need to be equally distributed to ensure no influx of health disparities in the response.
The Wealth Health Organization (WHO) Director‐General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated his condemnation of utilizing low and middle income countries as test subjects for clinical trials, yet having highly developed countries as the majority of clinical trial representation is also not the answer [@doi:10.1002/eahr.500055].
Figure X showcases two choropleths detailing Covid-19 clinical trial recruitment by country.
The first choropleth only recruits from a singular country while the second choropleth recruits from multiple countries.
In the first choropleth, China, the United States, and France are among the countries with the most clinical trial recruiting.
However, in regards to recruiting multiple countries, only the United States and some European countries have made an effort to include other countries in clinical trials.
In addition, many countries have little to no clinical trial recruiting, which may create inconclusivity in the data from clinical trials.
Especially with Covid-19, equitable access to therapeutics and vaccines have been at the forefront, yet figures like the choropleths show the lack of transparency.
Thus, singular governments might prioritize their people with vaccines, causing unequal health outcomes [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6641].
Especially, with the closing of borders, keeping resources, and exiling foreigners [continue]
 
When there is equal opportunity to participate in clinical trials, there is an insignificant difference in participation between racial groups [@doi:10.1002/cncr.28483].
However, within the United States, racial minorities, such as, African-Americans, have disproportionately lower representation in clinical trials.
Similarly, African-Americans are the most affected racial demographic by Covid-19.
Some studies suggest communication between physicians and patients impacts whether or not a physician offers a patient participation in a clinical trial.
The researchers utilized a linguistic analysis to assess mean word count of  phrases like voluntary participation, clinical trial, and etc.
The data states that the mean word count of the entire visit is 1.5 more for white patients in comparisons to Black patients.
In addition, a figure shows that the greatest disparity between white and Black patients is discussion on risks with over 2 times as many words spoken with white patients than that of Black patients [@doi:10.1002/cncr.28483].
Thus, it is likely that Covid-19 clinical trial information is not being equally discussed with Black patients. 
 
Some plausible reasons for the disparity in communication between physicians and patients could be a lack of awareness and education, mistrust in healthcare professionals, and lack of health insurance [@doi:10.1002/cncr.28483].

<!--### Indirect Effects of the Pandemic

Besides the direct harms caused by infection, many populations are in indirect risk of serious harm due to the social and economic effects of the pandemic and of the efforts needed to fight it.
These might include individuals with substance use disorder [@doi:10.7326/M20-1141], victims of natural disasters [@doi:10.1038/s41558-020-0804-2], and victims of human trafficking [@doi:10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100409].
The pandemic could also delay the fight against other major infectious diseases, such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, potentially leading to a further increase of mortality [@doi:10.25561/78670].
Although they are beyond the scope of this paper, further research is needed in order to prevent these harms. <!-- there are already some policy recommendations in literature that we cite - we should probably direct folks there. I think we probably want a stronger synthesis and closing than this -->
